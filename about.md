The notes and outline on this site are based on notes I took in Civil Procedure at <a href="https://www.law.cuny.edu/">CUNY School of Law</a> in the summer of 2021, and then when preparing to take the bar exam in the summer of 2024. I chose to organize my work on a static site in order to have a lot of control over its structure and form, following <a href="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">minimal computing principles</a> for legibility, durability, ease and flexibility. The Jekyll theme I used to build this site is <a href="https://minicomp.github.io/ed/">Ed.</a>, distributed under an MIT license, software copyright (c) 2016–present Alex Gil, Karl Stolley, and contributors.
