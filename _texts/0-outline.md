---

A tort is an act or omission that gives rise to injury or harm to another and amounts to a civil wrong for which courts impose liability. In the context of torts, "injury" describes the invasion of any legal right, whereas "harm" describes a loss or detriment that an individual suffers.
Torts claims are governed by common law and state statutory law. Judges have wide latitude in determining which actions qualify as legally cognizable wrongs, which defenses may override any given claim, and the appropriate measure of damages. Although tort law varies by state, many courts utilize the Restatement of Torts (2nd) as an influential guide.
Torts fall into three general categories. These are (1) **intentional torts**; (2)  **negligent torts**; and (3) strict liability torts (e.g., liability for making and selling defective products or products liability).

## Approach for torts questions

1.	Is this torts (not criminal law or something else)?
2.	Who is the plaintiff?
3.	Who is the defendant or responsible parties?
4.	What is the harm?
5.	What legal theory or theories can the plaintiff assert?

## Intentional Torts

Intentional torts are wrongs that the defendant knew or should have known would result through their actions or omissions. Elements of intentional torts are (1) voluntary act; (2) intent; (3) causation; and (4) harm.

---

## Voluntary Act

A voluntary act is an act performed consciously or willingly. A purely reflexive act in not a voluntary act.

---

## Intent

Under torts law, there is intent if the defendant either desired the act to cause a harmful result (purpose intent); or knew with substantial certainty that such a result would occur (knowledge intent).

If the defendant acted with necessary intent to inflict certain intentional torts against a person, but instead caused injury to another person, the defendant’s intent is transferred to the injured person. Transferred intent only applies to (1) battery, (2) assault, (3) false imprisonment, (4) trespass to land, and (5) trespass to chattels.

---

## Causation

There is causation if the defendant’s act or a force set in motion by the defendant caused the plaintiff’s injury.

---

## Harm

Varies based on the kind of tort. *Ways to establish harm: (1) establish elements of the tort; (2) prove specific injury.*

Liability for an intentional tort requires that there are no applicable privileges or defenses.

---

## Battery

A person is liable for the intentional tort of battery if they intentionally cause harmful or offensive contact with another person or with something closely connected to the other person. For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant either (1) desired to cause an immediate harmful or offensive contact; or (2) knew that such contact was substantially certain to occur.

A harmful contact of battery is contact causing physical impairment or injury. An offensive contact of battery is a contact that makes a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities feel threatened.

Even if the plaintiff doesn’t suffer actual damages, they can claim nominal damages. Thus, their proof of actual harm is not required in a battery. If a defendant acts with malice (e.g., deliberate disregard of a high probability of harm), the plaintiff may claim punitive damages. For unforeseen consequences, the defendant may still be liable under the “eggshell rule.”

*The injured person does not need to be aware of the contact (unlike assault).*

*The plaintiff does not have to prove injury; will get compensatory damages just by showing the elements.*

*Watch out for Privileges and defenses – **consent** comes up a lot in the context of battery.*

---

## Assault

A person is liable for the intentional tort of assault if they intentionally cause a person to be in reasonable apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact. For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant either (1) desired to cause an immediate harmful or offensive contact or the reasonable apprehension of such contact; or (2) knew that such a result was substantially certain to occur. It does not matter if the goal of the actor was merely to scare the victim or if the act was meant as a joke. The actor need not have intended for the contact to be harmful or offensive, only to have intended the actual contact.

For a person to have a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact, the person must have a reasonable belief that the act will lead to imminent harmful or offensive contact. The plaintiff must show that a reasonable person in the same position as the plaintiff would have experienced the same apprehension. If the apprehension is reasonable, it doesn’t matter whether D could actually carry out the threat. *For instance, brandishing an unloaded gun can still be assault.*

The victim does not need to prove fear, only that they were aware that such a contact might occur. If the victim and the tortfeasor do not know each other, then the legal standard is what an ordinary reasonable person under the same circumstances as the victim would have believed.

If the victim and tortfeasor have special knowledge of each other, this special knowledge may be considered when determining whether the victim’s apprehension was reasonable.

“Imminent” in the context of assault, means the threatened harmful or offensive contact must be certain or likely to occur very soon.

“Harmful or offensive” in the context of assault, is an objective standard referring to touching that is likely to or capable of causing harm or offending a reasonable person by violating prevailing social standards of acceptable touching.

An otherwise inoffensive contact may be deemed offensive if the tortfeasor knew the victim was unusually averse to such a contact.

There is some disagreement among jurisdictions in regard to the role of consent.

*Look for words that negate intent. For example, “If it weren’t a tort, I would punch you in the face.” These negate the intent and you won’t be able to say there was a tort.*

*Words alone rarely create an assault.*

Assault is typically paired with battery as assault and battery. In assault and battery, assault refers to the act that causes the victim to immediately apprehend a harmful or offensive contact, whereas battery refers to the act that causes the actual contact. * Some jurisdictions label assault as attempted battery.*

For imminent battery, battery must be able to occur almost instantly.

## False Imprisonment

A person commits false imprisonment when they intentionally confine another person in a restricted area against the confined person’s will and the confined person knows of the confinement or is injured by it. False imprisonment is an intentional tort.

For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant either (1) desired to confine or restrain the confined person in a restricted area; or (2) knew that such confinement was virtually certain to result.

Confinement can consist of physical barriers, threats of force, failing to release the confined person after a duty to release arises, or the invalid assertion of legal authority.

There is no duration requirement. For there to be false imprisonment, the confinement can be very brief.

If the confined person has actual knowledge of a reasonable means of escape, then there is no confinement and no liability. A reasonable means of escape is one where there is no threat of harm to the confined person or their property, and will not expose the confined person to risk of embarrassment.

The confinement must be against the confined person’s will. Consent is a defense to false imprisonment.

If the harmed person was aware of the confinement, they are entitled to any damages the jury finds appropriate.

If the harmed person was unaware of the confinement, they can only claim damages if they were injured by the confinement.

---

## Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress

A person commits intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) when they intentionally or recklessly act in a manner that causes another person to suffer severe emotional distress. IIED is an intentional tort.

For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with a desire to cause severe emotional distress or knew that such severe emotional distress was virtually certain to occur.

For there to be recklessness, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted in conscious disregard of a high degree of probability that their actions would cause the plaintiff severe emotional distress.

Extreme and outrageous conduct is conduct that exceeds all bounds tolerated by civilized society. Offensive or insulting language generally not enough, except when the defendant (1) is a common carrier or innkeeper; (2) knows of the plaintiff’s particular sensitivity; or (3) is an authority figure using racial or ethnic slurs against a subordinate.

The emotional distress must be severe. Severe emotional distress is emotional distress greater than a reasonable person would be expected to endure.

The severe emotional distress must be long lasting as opposed to transitory.

---

## Trespass to Land

A person is liable for trespass to land if they physically invade or cause an object or a third party to physically invade another person’s land. Trespass to land is an intentional tort. Instead of intent to trespass, there must be an intent to enter or remain on the land. The trespasser does not have to know that the land is owned or possessed by another person. The owner or possessor of the land does not have to prove that they suffered actual damages.

To show intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant either (1) desired to enter the land or cause something to enter the land, or (2) knew that land entry was substantially certain to result.

Mistake is not a defense to trespass to land.

Anyone in possession of the land can bring a trespass to land claim (landowner, tenant, adverse possessor).

Remedies include damages including nominal damages. The defendant is liable for the full extent of harm caused by the trespass.

The plaintiff can also seek the restitutionary remedy of ejectment in order to have the defendant removed from the land.

---

## Trespass to Chattels

A person is liable for trespass to chattels if they intentionally deprive or prevent another person from using their legally possessed personal property (chattel). Trespass to chattels is an intentional tort.

For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant intentionally performed the physical act that interfered with the plaintiff’s chattel. Interference is using or borrowing another person’s chattel without their permission. For trespass to chattels, the intent to trespass is not required. Mistake is not a defense.

There must be actual damage, but it does not need to be actual damage to the chattel itself. Actual damages include the value of loss of use of the chattel during a dispossession or the cost to remedy an intermeddling. If the intermeddling with a chattel is harmless, there is no trespass to chattel.  

Remedies include damages such as cost of repair, fair market rental value, as well as punitive damages if the defendant is a particularly bad actor (willful, wanton, or malicious conduct).

Replevin is a legal action that allows a person to recover personal property of which they were wrongfully dispossessed. A writ of replevin orders the defendant to return property to its rightful owner. [^1]

[^1]:"replevin" comes from the Old French word "replevir," which means "to recover or take back." It is derived from the Latin word "replegere," which means "to take back or regain."

---

## Trespass to Conversion

A person is liable for trespass to conversion if they intentionally exercise dominion or control over or cause the destruction of or serious and substantial interference with another person’s chattel.

Mistake is not a defense. A defendant is liable for conversion even if acting in good faith.

Destruction or Serious and Substantial Interference is the exercise by the defendant of dominion and control over the chattel.

*Interference with plaintiff’s property interest is more significant than trespass to chattel. Longer period of interference and greater use by defendant leads to conversion.*

Remedies include forced sale (common), where the price will be the fair market value at the time the chattel was converted, and replevin.

## Table

| Trespass to Chattels | Conversion |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Intentional tort | Intentional tort |
| Committed by intentionally dispossessing or intermeddling with a chattel in the possession of another. | Committed by intentionally exercising dominion or control over a chattel and seriously interfering with the rights of the owner. |
| Defendant is liable for damage or diminished value of chattel. | Defendant is liable for the full value of the chattel at the time of the conversion. |

## Defenses and Privileges to Intentional Torts

In tort law, privileges are often used as defenses. So, when we say "defense of others" is a privilege, we also imply it is a defense because the defendant is using the privilege as a reason to avoid liability.

---

## Consent

Consent is usually a defense for battery and assault.

---

## Express Consent

Under torts law, express consent is when a plaintiff affirmatively communicates permission for a defendant to act. Express consent is limited by reasonability, meaning that the defendant’s actions cannot exceed the scope of the consent.

---

## Implied consent

Under torts law, implied consent exists if a reasonable person would interpret the plaintiff’s conduct as giving the defendant permission to act.

*For example, if a person is elbowed and hurt while playing basketball, even if the elbowing was intentional, the defendant had impliedly consented to being elbowed by agreeing to play a game where elbowing tends to happen and is foreseeable.*

Mistake can negate consent **when it goes to the consequences or nature of the act**.

*For example, if woman brings tort claim against man for giving her STD and before having sex had asked man if he had STD and man had said no I don’t so woman agreed to not use protection, woman has a tort claim because mistake about man’s STD status went to heart of claim.*

---

## Self-Defense

Self-defense is a defense in torts law against charges of assault, battery and other intentional torts. Self-defense in torts allows a person to use reasonable and proportionate force to protect themselves from imminent harm, provided their belief in the necessity of such force is reasonable.
The defendant must have a reasonable belief that they were in imminent danger.

The force used in self-defense must be proportionate to the threat.

The threat must be imminent and not a future or past threat.  

Deadly force cannot be used in response to a non-deadly threat.

In some jurisdictions there is a duty to retreat before using deadly force if it is safe to do so. However, this duty does not apply in one's own home (the "castle doctrine").

---

## Defense of Others

In an intentional torts claim a defendant can assert the privilege of defense of others. Under this privilege, a defendant is entitled to defend another from attack to the same extent that the other person is lawfully entitled to defend themselves. However, the defendant is liable if they acted by mistake.

---

## Defense of Property

In an intentional torts claim a defendant can assert the privilege of defense of property. Under this privilege, a defendant can use reasonable force to defend real or personal property. A defendant may never use deadly force to protect personal or real property.

*Look for situations that start with defense of property and escalate to become defense of self or others.*

A defendant may use reasonable force to eject a trespasser after asking them to leave.

A defendant may use reasonable, non-deadly force may be used to recapture chattels (get back own personal property) if the person seeking to recapture requests its return first or a request would be futile; and defendant is in hot pursuit.

*For example, if Billy took Charlie’s jacket, Charlie asked for it back, Billy ran off with the jacket, Charlie can chase Billy and use reasonable force to get the jacket back.*

---

## Authority Privilege

In an intentional torts claim a defendant can assert the privilege of authority. Under this privilege, a police officer can arrest a person if they reasonably believe the person committed a felony; a police officer can arrest a person for a misdemeanor if the person breached the peace. A private person making a “citizen’s arrest” does not have the privilege of authority, and if their belief is wrong they are liable for tort.

---

## Shopkeeper’s Privilege

A shopkeeper is not liable for false imprisonment if they had a reasonable suspicion that the defendant stole something from the shop. A shopkeeper can only detain a person for a reasonable amount of time and in a reasonable manner on the premises or immediate vicinity.

---

## Parent Teacher Discipline Privilege

A parent or teacher may use reasonable force to discipline a child.

---

## Necessity Privilege

A defendant may damage a plaintiff’s property if such damage is reasonably necessary to avoid a substantially greater harm to the public, self, or the defendant’s property.

---

## Public Necessity

In tort law, the public necessity defense can be used against charges of trespass or conversion where a defendant reasonably believes interference with a plaintiff’s property is necessary to prevent an imminent emergency situation. The defendant must reasonably believe that the emergency cannot be prevented in some other reasonable way, and must also use reasonable care to avoid causing greater harm than the harm that was averted.

Public necessity serves as an absolute defense, meaning that a defendant will not be liable for any damages caused by its trespass or conversion.

---

## Private Necessity

Private necessity is a defense in tort law against charges of trespass in situations where defendants have interfered with the plaintiff's property in an emergency to advance or protect their own interests. The privilege of private necessity must be exercised at a reasonable time, in a reasonable manner, and in light of all the circumstances. The property owner owes a duty of reasonable care under the circumstances.

Private necessity does not serve as an absolute defense to liability for trespass. A defendant who commits trespass and invokes the defense of private necessity must still pay for any harm done to the property caused by the trespass. However, the defendant is not liable for nominal or punitive damages.

If the emergency which caused the defendant to commit trespass on the plaintiff's property continues, the defendant is entitled to remain on the plaintiff's land and cannot be ejected as long as the emergency continues.
