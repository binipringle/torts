A tort is an act or omission that gives rise to injury or harm[^1] to another and amounts to a civil wrong for which courts impose liability.[^2] Torts fall into three general categories. These are (1) **intentional torts**; (2)  **negligent torts**; and (3) **strict liability torts**.[^3]

[^1]:In the context of torts, "injury" describes the invasion of any legal right, whereas "harm" describes a loss or detriment that an individual suffers.

[^2]:Torts claims are governed by common law and state statutory law. Judges have wide latitude in determining which actions qualify as legally cognizable wrongs, which defenses may override any given claim, and the appropriate measure of damages. Although tort law varies by state, many courts utilize the Restatement of Torts (2nd) as an influential guide.

[^3]:General rule and other rules in this outline adapted from Legal Information Institute, Cornell Law School.

# Intentional Torts

An intentional tort is an injury or harm that the defendant knew or should have known would result from their act or omission. Elements of intentional torts are (1) voluntary act; (2) intent; (3) causation; and (4) harm.

---

### Voluntary Act

A voluntary act is an act performed consciously or willingly. A purely reflexive act in not a voluntary act.

---

### Intent

Under torts law, there is intent if the defendant either desired the act to cause a harmful result or knew with substantial certainty that such a result would occur.

If the defendant acted with intent to inflict intentional torts against a person but instead injured another person, the defendant’s intent transfers to the other person. Transferred intent only applies to (1) battery, (2) assault, (3) false imprisonment, (4) trespass to land, and (5) trespass to chattels.

---

### Causation for Intentional Torts

There is causation if the defendant’s act or a force set in motion by the defendant's act caused the plaintiff’s injury.

---

### Harm for Intentional Torts

Liability for an intentional tort requires that there are no applicable privileges or defenses.

*Varies based on the kind of tort. Ways to establish harm for intentional tort: (1) establish elements of the tort; (2) prove specific injury.*

---

### Assault

A person is liable for the tort of assault if they intentionally cause a person to be in reasonable apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact. For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant either (1) desired to cause (a) an immediate harmful or offensive contact or (b) the apprehension of such contact; or (2) knew that such a result was substantially certain to occur. It does not matter if the actor just wanted to scare the victim or if the act was meant as a joke. The actor does not need to have intended the contact to be harmful or offensive, only to have intended the contact.

For a person to have a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact, the person must have a reasonable belief that the act will lead to imminent harmful or offensive contact. The plaintiff must show that a reasonable person in the same position as the plaintiff would have experienced the same apprehension. If the apprehension is reasonable, it doesn’t matter whether the defendant could actually carry out the threat. *For instance, brandishing an unloaded gun can be assault.* The victim does not need to prove fear.

If the victim and the tortfeasor do not know each other, then the legal standard is what an ordinary reasonable person under the same circumstances as the victim would have believed.

If the victim and tortfeasor have special knowledge of each other, this special knowledge may be considered when determining whether the victim’s apprehension was reasonable.

“Imminent” in the context of assault means the threatened harmful or offensive contact must be certain or likely to occur very soon.

“Harmful or offensive” in the context of assault is an objective standard referring to touching that is likely to or capable of causing harm or offending a reasonable person by violating prevailing social standards of acceptable touching. An otherwise inoffensive contact may be deemed offensive if the tortfeasor knew the victim was unusually averse to such a contact.

There is some disagreement among jurisdictions with regard to the role of consent.

*Look for words that negate intent. For example, “If it weren’t a tort, I would punch you in the face.” These negate the intent and you won’t be able to say there was a tort.*

*Words alone rarely create an assault.*

Assault is typically paired with battery as assault and battery. In assault and battery, assault refers to the act that causes the victim to immediately apprehend a harmful or offensive contact, whereas battery refers to the act that causes the actual contact. * Some jurisdictions label assault as attempted battery.

---

### Battery

A person is liable for the tort of battery if they intentionally cause harmful or offensive contact with another person or with something closely connected to the other person. For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant either (1) desired to cause an immediate harmful or offensive contact; or (2) knew that such contact was substantially certain to occur.

A harmful contact is contact causing physical impairment or injury. An offensive contact is a contact that makes a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities feel threatened.

Proof of actual injury is not required in a battery. Even if the plaintiff doesn’t suffer actual injury, they can claim nominal damages. If a defendant acts with malice, the plaintiff may claim punitive damages. Malice is the deliberate disregard of a high probability of harm.  For unforeseen consequences, the defendant may still be liable under the eggshell plaintiff rule.

*The injured person does not need to be aware of the contact (unlike assault).*

*Watch out for Privileges and defenses – **consent** comes up a lot in the context of battery.*

---

### False Imprisonment

A person commits false imprisonment when they (1) intentionally confine another person in a restricted area (2) against the confined person’s will and (3) the confined person (a) knows of the confinement or (b) is injured by it. False imprisonment is an intentional tort.

For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant either (1) desired to confine or restrain the confined person in a restricted area; or (2) knew that such confinement was virtually certain to result.

Confinement can consist of physical barriers, threats of force, failing to release the confined person after a duty to release arises, or the invalid assertion of legal authority.

There is no duration requirement. For there to be false imprisonment, the confinement can be very brief.

If the confined person has actual knowledge of a reasonable means of escape, then there is no confinement and no liability. A reasonable means of escape is one where there is no threat of harm to the confined person or their property, and will not expose the confined person to risk of embarrassment.

The confinement must be against the confined person’s will. Consent is a defense to false imprisonment.

If the harmed person was aware of the confinement, they are entitled to any damages the jury finds appropriate.

If the harmed person was unaware of the confinement, they can only claim damages if they were injured by the confinement.

---

### Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress

A person commits intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) when they intentionally or recklessly act in a manner that causes another person to suffer severe emotional distress. IIED is an intentional tort.

For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with a desire to cause severe emotional distress or knew that such severe emotional distress was virtually certain to occur.

For there to be recklessness, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted in conscious disregard of a high degree of probability that their actions would cause the plaintiff severe emotional distress.

Extreme and outrageous conduct is conduct that exceeds all bounds tolerated by civilized society. Offensive or insulting language generally not enough, except when the defendant (1) is a common carrier or innkeeper; (2) knows of the plaintiff’s particular sensitivity; or (3) is an authority figure using racial or ethnic slurs against a subordinate.

The emotional distress must be severe. Severe emotional distress is emotional distress greater than a reasonable person would be expected to endure.

The severe emotional distress must be long lasting as opposed to transitory.

---

### Trespass to Land

A person is liable for trespass to land if they physically invade or cause an object or a third party to physically invade another person’s land. Trespass to land is an intentional tort. Instead of intent to trespass, there must be an intent to enter or remain on the land. The trespasser does not have to know that the land is owned or possessed by another person. The owner or possessor of the land does not have to prove that they suffered actual damages.

To show intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant either (1) desired to enter the land or cause something to enter the land, or (2) knew that land entry was substantially certain to result.

Mistake is not a defense to trespass to land.

Anyone in possession of the land can bring a trespass to land claim (landowner, tenant, adverse possessor).

Remedies include damages including nominal damages. The defendant is liable for the full extent of harm caused by the trespass.

The plaintiff can also seek the restitutionary remedy of ejectment in order to have the defendant removed from the land.

---

### Trespass to Chattels

A person is liable for trespass to chattels if they intentionally deprive or prevent another person from using their legally possessed personal property (chattel). Trespass to chattels is an intentional tort.

For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant intentionally performed the physical act that interfered with the plaintiff’s chattel. Interference is using or borrowing another person’s chattel without their permission. For trespass to chattels, the intent to trespass is not required. Mistake is not a defense.

There must be actual damage, but it does not need to be actual damage to the chattel itself. Actual damages include the value of loss of use of the chattel during a dispossession or the cost to remedy an intermeddling. If the intermeddling with a chattel is harmless, there is no trespass to chattel.  

Remedies include damages such as cost of repair, fair market rental value, as well as punitive damages if the defendant is a particularly bad actor (willful, wanton, or malicious conduct).

Replevin is a legal action that allows a person to recover personal property of which they were wrongfully dispossessed. A writ of replevin orders the defendant to return property to its rightful owner. [^4]

[^4]:"replevin" comes from the Old French word "replevir," which means "to recover or take back." It is derived from the Latin word "replegere," which means "to take back or regain."

---

### Conversion

A person is liable for conversion if they intentionally exercise dominion or control over or cause the destruction of or serious and substantial interference with another person’s chattel.

Mistake is not a defense. A defendant is liable for conversion even if acting in good faith.

Destruction or Serious and Substantial Interference is the exercise by the defendant of dominion and control over the chattel.

*Interference with plaintiff’s property interest is more significant than trespass to chattel. Longer period of interference and greater use by defendant leads to conversion.*

Remedies include forced sale (common), where the price will be the fair market value at the time the chattel was converted, and replevin.

---

| Trespass to Chattels | Conversion |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Intentional tort | Intentional tort |
| Committed by intentionally dispossessing or intermeddling with a chattel in the possession of another. | Committed by intentionally exercising dominion or control over a chattel and seriously interfering with the rights of the owner. |
| Defendant is liable for damage or diminished value of chattel. | Defendant is liable for the full value of the chattel at the time of the conversion. |

---

### Defenses and Privileges to Intentional Torts

In tort law, privileges are often used as defenses. So, when we say "defense of others" is a privilege, we also imply it is a defense because the defendant is using the privilege as a reason to avoid liability.

---

### Consent

Consent is usually a defense for battery and assault.

---

### Express Consent

Under torts law, express consent is when a plaintiff affirmatively communicates permission for a defendant to act. Express consent is limited by reasonability, meaning that the defendant’s actions cannot exceed the scope of the consent.

---

### Implied consent

Under torts law, implied consent exists if a reasonable person would interpret the plaintiff’s conduct as giving the defendant permission to act.

*For example, if a person is elbowed and hurt while playing basketball, even if the elbowing was intentional, the defendant had impliedly consented to being elbowed by agreeing to play a game where elbowing tends to happen and is foreseeable.*

Mistake can negate consent **when it goes to the consequences or nature of the act**.

*For example, if woman brings tort claim against man for giving her STD and before having sex had asked man if he had STD and man had said no I don’t so woman agreed to not use protection, woman has a tort claim because mistake about man’s STD status went to heart of claim.*

---

### Self-Defense

Self-defense is a defense in torts law against charges of assault, battery and other intentional torts. Self-defense in torts allows a person to use reasonable and proportionate force to protect themselves from imminent harm, provided their belief in the necessity of such force is reasonable.
The defendant must have a reasonable belief that they were in imminent danger.

The force used in self-defense must be proportionate to the threat.

The threat must be imminent and not a future or past threat.  

Deadly force cannot be used in response to a non-deadly threat.

In some jurisdictions there is a duty to retreat before using deadly force if it is safe to do so. However, this duty does not apply in one's own home (the "castle doctrine").

---

### Defense of Others

In an intentional torts claim a defendant can assert the privilege of defense of others. Under this privilege, a defendant is entitled to defend another from attack to the same extent that the other person is lawfully entitled to defend themselves. However, the defendant is liable if they acted by mistake.

---

### Defense of Property

In an intentional torts claim a defendant can assert the privilege of defense of property. Under this privilege, a defendant can use reasonable force to defend real or personal property. A defendant may never use deadly force to protect personal or real property.

*Look for situations that start with defense of property and escalate to become defense of self or others.*

A defendant may use reasonable force to eject a trespasser after asking them to leave.

A defendant may use reasonable, non-deadly force may be used to recapture chattels (get back own personal property) if the person seeking to recapture requests its return first or a request would be futile; and defendant is in hot pursuit.

*For example, if Billy took Charlie’s jacket, Charlie asked for it back, Billy ran off with the jacket, Charlie can chase Billy and use reasonable force to get the jacket back.*

---

### Authority Privilege

In an intentional torts claim a defendant can assert the privilege of authority. Under this privilege, a police officer can arrest a person if they reasonably believe the person committed a felony; a police officer can arrest a person for a misdemeanor if the person breached the peace. A private person making a “citizen’s arrest” does not have the privilege of authority, and if their belief is wrong they are liable for tort.

---

### Shopkeepers Privilege

A shopkeeper is not liable for false imprisonment if they had a reasonable suspicion that the defendant stole something from the shop. A shopkeeper can only detain a person for a reasonable amount of time and in a reasonable manner on the premises or immediate vicinity.

---

### Parent Teacher Discipline Privilege

A parent or teacher may use reasonable force to discipline a child.

---

### Necessity Privilege

A defendant may damage a plaintiff’s property if such damage is reasonably necessary to avoid a substantially greater harm to the public, self, or the defendant’s property.

---

### Public Necessity

In tort law, the public necessity defense can be used against charges of trespass or conversion where a defendant reasonably believes interference with a plaintiff’s property is necessary to prevent an imminent emergency situation. The defendant must reasonably believe that the emergency cannot be prevented in some other reasonable way, and must also use reasonable care to avoid causing greater harm than the harm that was averted.

Public necessity serves as an absolute defense, meaning that a defendant will not be liable for any damages caused by its trespass or conversion.

---

### Private Necessity

Private necessity is a defense in tort law against charges of trespass in situations where defendants have interfered with the plaintiff's property in an emergency to advance or protect their own interests. The privilege of private necessity must be exercised at a reasonable time, in a reasonable manner, and in light of all the circumstances. The property owner owes a duty of reasonable care under the circumstances.

Private necessity does not serve as an absolute defense to liability for trespass. A defendant who commits trespass and invokes the defense of private necessity must still pay for any harm done to the property caused by the trespass. However, the defendant is not liable for nominal or punitive damages.

If the emergency which caused the defendant to commit trespass on the plaintiff's property continues, the defendant is entitled to remain on the plaintiff's land and cannot be ejected as long as the emergency continues.

---

# Negligence

To bring a cause of action for negligence, the plaintiff has to prove that (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the defendant’s breach caused the plaintiff’s harm; and (5) the plaintiff suffered legally compensable harm.

---

### Burden of Proof for Negligence

The plaintiff has the burden to prove all elements of negligence by a preponderance of the evidence.

---

## Duty

Under torts law, people do not generally have an affirmative duty to protect others. However, a defendant generally owes a duty to foreseeable plaintiffs. The test for foreseeability is whether the defendant could have reasonably predicted that their actions could harm the plaintiff.

To be a foreseeable plaintiff, the plaintiff must be within the zone of danger created by defendant’s conduct. To determine whether plaintiff is in the zone of danger, courts consider the relationship between plaintiff and defendant, the time and space between plaintiff and defendant’s breach, and other facts relevant to whether plaintiff was foreseeable.[^5]

[^5]:Rule from Core spring 2024: the test for foreseeability is whether the defendant could reasonably predict that their actions might cause harm to someone.

---

### Standard of Care

A defendant owes a foreseeable plaintiff the duty to act as a reasonably prudent person would act under the same or similar circumstances to protect foreseeable plaintiffs from unreasonable risks of harm.

The law does not take into account mental ability, speed of reflexes, or mental health. The law does take into account physical conditions (blind, deaf, amputee). In this case, defendant will be held to the standard of a reasonably prudent person with that condition.

Emergencies not of defendant’s own making can change the standard of care (for example, rushing to hospital because child is dying). Jury can consider emergency to determine if defendant acted reasonably under the circumstances.

---

### Eggshell Plaintiff Rule

Under the common law eggshell plaintiff rule, a defendant is liable for the full extent of a plaintiff’s injury if the type of injury was foreseeable, even if the scope of the injury was not foreseeable. This is true even when the plaintiff has a preexisting condition or sensitivity that exacerbates the injury.

---

### Children

The majority rule provides that minor defendant’s conduct is assessed according to what a reasonable child of the same age, experience, education, and intelligence as defendant would have done, except if the child was engaging in adult, inherently dangerous activities, in which case children are held to an adult standard of care (for example, driving).

---

### Rescuer

Generally, there is no duty to rescue another person unless the defendant has voluntarily undertaken the rescue. A defendant has a duty to act if they volunteered to protect the plaintiff from harm, possibly preventing others from protecting the plaintiff. The omission of actions may be negligent when the defendant had a duty to act. If an individual voluntarily initiates a rescue attempt, that individual has a duty to complete the rescue to the extent reasonably possible, especially if the person in need of rescue reasonably relied on the individual who initiated the rescue attempt. Nonprofessional rescuers are foreseeable plaintiff’s as a matter of policy and can recover against the negligent party creating the need.

If a defendant's tortious conduct creates the need to rescue, the defendant has a duty to rescue plaintiffs endangered by that conduct.

**A negligent defendant owes a rescuer an independent duty of care.** Courts recognize that a rescuer is a foreseeable plaintiff. Even when a rescuer is negligent in acting, the negligent defendant will be liable unless it is shown that the rescuer was wantonly reckless.

Professional rescuers (for example, police or firefighters) cannot recover in negligence against the person who created the need for rescue.

In some jurisdictions, a person who initially undertakes a rescue may cease acting so long as the endangered person is not left in a worse position than she would have been in had the undertaking never been initiated. This is contrary to the majority view, which requires a person undertaking a rescue to act reasonably.

Many states have good samaritan statutes that protect a rescuer unless she is reckless or engages in intentional wrongdoing.

*Special relationship of dependence or mutual dependence (carrier/passenger, inn keeper/guest, captain/passengers, drinking buddies).*

---

### Duty to Control Third Parties

Generally there is no duty to control the conduct of a third party to prevent harm to another. However, a special relationship between the defendant and a third party may create a duty to control a third party’s conduct.

---

### Therapist

A therapist who becomes aware that her patient presents a specific, credible threat of physical violence to **a specific person** has an affirmative duty to warn that specific person. *This is not a duty that requires a full analysis so don’t do breach or causation.*

---

### Duty to Protect Third Parties

A special relationship between the defendant and a third party may create a duty for the defendant to protect them.

Some jurisdictions only find duty where there is a special relationship **and** prior similar incidents that make the third party criminal conduct particularly foreseeable.

---

### Providers of Alcohol

Under the traditional rule, a provider of alcohol is not responsible for DUI injuries.

---

### Dram Shop Acts

The Dram Shop Acts impose liability on establishments when they know or should know that a patron is drunk and that person drives while intoxicated and harms a third party. The Dram Shop Acts do not apply to social hosts, but only to those who are licensed to sell alcohol.

---

### Negligent Entrustment

A defendant can be liable for negligent entrustment if they give something dangerous to a person they know or should know is not competent to handle it (for example, giving a gun to a small child).

---

### Business Invitee

A business has a duty to use reasonable care to prevent injuries to business invitees. A business invitee is a person welcomed inside or onto property by a business for commercial purposes. The business has a duty to discover dangerous artificial conditions that invitees would not reasonably be aware of, and warn invitees of the existence of such conditions or to make such conditions safe.

---

### Plaintiffs on Land

Plaintiffs on land can be (1) invitees; (2) licensees; or (3) tresspassers.

---

### Invitees

If a plaintiff enters onto defendant’s land at defendant’s express or implied invite and for a purpose relating to defendant’s interest or activities, the defendant has a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent injuries caused by activities conducted on defendant’s land.

---

### Licensees

If a plaintiff enters onto defendant’s land with defendant’s express or implied permission and are not there for a purpose benefiting defendant or defendant’s activities, nor is the land held open to the public, the defendant must warn of known concealed dangers (just warn, not cure) that are not obvious.

---

### Trespassers

If a plaintiff enters defendant’s land without express or implied consent of land possessor, the land possessor has a duty to avoid infliction of willful or wanton harm.

A land possessor owes a duty of reasonable care to all defendants engaged in an activity on the land except unknown trespassers.

If the trespasser is a known or frequent trespasser (must be obvious - e.g. a well-worn path), the land possessor has a duty to warn of known and concealed dangerous artificial conditions.

---

### Attractive Nuisance Doctrine

A land possessor has a heightened duty to prevent harm to a child caused by artificial conditions on the land, even if the child is trespassing. The plaintiff must show that (1) the child was too young to appreciate the danger; (2) defendant knew, or had reason to know, of the trespass; (3) defendant knew of the dangerous condition; (4) the condition is artificial (fountain, pool, equipment that looks fun to climb on); and (5) the risk of danger of the artificial condition outweighs its utility and burden to fix it.

---

### Plaintiff Adjacent to Land

A land possessor has a duty of reasonable care to prevent harm from artificial conditions to plaintiffs who are adjacent to the land.

A land possessor has no duty to prevent harm to adjacent plaintiffs from natural condition on land, except from trees in urban areas.

---

### Landlord Tenant

A landlord may be liable for injuries in common areas over which the landlord retains control; negligent repairs; a concealed dangerous condition that the landlord knew about at time of lease; or knowledge that tenant is going to hold property open to public.

---

## Breach for Negligence

A defendant breached their duty of care if they failed to act as a reasonably prudent person would have acted under the same or similar circumstances. A reasonably prudent person takes precautions to avoid foreseeable risks.

---

### Hand Formula

To determine whether there was breach, courts look at (1) the probability of harm occurring from defendant’s conduct; (2) the likely magnitude of the harm; and (3) the burden on defendant to avoid the harm.

---

### Carroll Towing Test

For the reasonably prudent person standard, breach is determined through the application of the Carroll Towing test, which weighs the burden of taking precautions and/or engaging in alternative conduct against the likelihood of harm due to the breach and the potential gravity of harm due to the breach. When likelihood of harm and potential gravity of harm outweigh defendant's burden of taking precautions, defendant has breached.

---

### Res Ipsa Loquitur

Res ipsa loquitur is only used to show breach. If successfully invoked, the jury can draw an inference of the breach. To prove res ipsa loquitur, the plaintiff must show that (1) the type of accident does not normally occur unless there was negligence; (2) the defendant had control over instrumentality of the harm; and (3) the plaintiff did not contribute to the injury.

Res ipsa loquitur can be used in medical malpractice cases.

The plaintiff does not have to prove the three elements listed above under the **common knowledge exception** when for example equipment is sewn into a plaintiff or a sponge is left inside a plaintiff after surgery, the plaintiff does not need experts to establish that this is negligent conduct.

Res ipsa loquitur usually cannot be used in multiple defendant cases, except where a medical team is acting as a unit. In such as case, the defendants will be held jointly and severally liable unless individual defendants prove that they did not cause the injury.

---

### Superior Knowledge

Superior knowledge does not change the reasonably prudent person standard, but it should be considered in the context of the breach analysis. That defendant had superior knowledge or experience is part of the circumstances, and the defendant is expected to act reasonably with that knowledge or experience. A jury can consider how a reasonable person would behave if they knew of the dangers known to the defendant.[^6]

[^6]:Superior knowledge doesn’t tend to change likelihood of harm or potential gravity; goes to burden if the defendant did not have the burden of getting information because they had it.

---

### Dangerous Instrumentality

The standard of care for negligence actions involving dangerous instrumentalities and/or dangerous circumstances remains the reasonably prudent person standard *under the circumstances*. Though the standard of care does not vary, the degree of care that is reasonable varies, and must be  proportionate to the foreseeable danger of the activity. Dangerous instrumentality should be considered in the context of the breach analysis.[^7]

[^7]:Dangerous instrumentality heightens likelihood of harm. Can also go to potential gravity.

---

### Mental Disability

Mental disability is not considered part of the circumstances, so a person with mental disability is held to the same general standard of care as a reasonably prudent person without mental disability. Therefore, [defendant’s mental disability] does not change the reasonably prudent person standard and cannot be considered in the context of the breach analysis.

---

### Private Standard and Industry Customs

The defendant may have adhered to private standard and industry customs when they acted in a way that caused harm. The private standard and industry custom does not change the reasonably prudent person standard of care, but evidence of private standards and industry customs are admissible at trial, and can impact the breach analysis. However, such evidence does not in itself determine whether the defendant adhered to the ordinary duty of care.[^8]

[^8]:Private standard and industry custom can heighten burden – think of netting which was not customarily installed in the U.S. but anyway was easy and cheap to install so burden to put up netting was low.

---

### Medical Malpractice

Physicians are required to possess and use the knowledge, skill, and training of other physicians in good standing in the relevant geographic community. Specialists are held to the national standard. General practitioners are held to the locality standard.

---

### Lack of Informed Consent

Under the traditional rule, a physician is liable for battery if there was no informed consent about risks. In that case, the patient’s consent is negated because of lack of disclosure. This is still the case when there is a gross deviation from actual consent (for example, a plaintiff agrees to tonsillectomy, but leg is amputated instead). The traditional standard is a physician must divulge risks that are customarily divulged by a physician in the same set of circumstances.

---

### New Trend Standard of Materiality

A physician must divulge all **material** risks, meaning risks that a reasonable patient would want to know in deciding whether to undergo the procedure or treatment. Failure to divulge material risk is malpractice if plaintiff can show she would have refused the procedure if the physician divulged the risk.

---

### Lawyers Architects Accountants

So long as the professional complies with custom, the professional cannot be found to have breached their duty. A deviation from custom means breach of that duty, **except where customs are outdated and/or unreasonable that a court might reject.**

---

## Negligence Per Se

Negligence is conduct that falls below the applicable standard of care. A prima facie negligence claim requires that (1) defendant owed plaintiff a duty of care; (2) defendant breached the duty owed; (3) defendant’s breach was the actual cause of plaintiff’s harm; (4) defendant’s breach was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s harm; and (5) plaintiff suffered legally compensable harm.

Where there is a relevant statute, negligence per se may apply. Negligence per se is the unexcused breach of a specific judge-made or legislature-made law establishing the duty of care. Negligence per se resolves only the duty and breach elements. To prove the entire negligence cause of action, a plaintiff must also show that there was factual causation, proximate causation and actual harm.

*If negligence per se is not satisfied, then the statute does not substitute the reasonably prudent person standard, negligence per se fails, and you default back to using the reasonably prudent person standard.*

---

### Duty for Negligence Per Se

To replace the general duty of care with a duty of care from a statute, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the statute clearly defines the required standard of conduct applicable to the facts of the case; (2) the statute was intended to prevent the type of harm the defendant’s act or omission caused; and (3) the plaintiff is a member of the class of persons the statute was designed to protect.

---

### Breach for Negligence Per Se

Even where a defendant breaches a statutory duty of care, they are not negligent if they have a legally sufficient excuse for violating the statute. Legally sufficient excuses for violating a statute include (1) incapacity; (2) not knowing of occasion for compliance; (3) inability to comply after reasonable diligence or care; (4) emergency not due to own misconduct; and (5) compliance involving greater risk of harm to defendant or others.

---

# Causation

Under torts law, causation is satisfied if there is actual cause and proximate cause.

---

### Actual Cause

A defendant’s conduct is the actual cause of the plaintiff's harm if that harm would not have occurred but for the defendant’s conduct.

To satisfy this standard, defendant’s breach need not be the sole “but for” cause, just a “but for” cause, of plaintiff’s harm.

*If but-for test fails, see if breaching conduct was actual cause under an alternative theory of factual causation.*

---

### Alternative Theory of Actual Causation

In order to serve the underlying goals of tort law, compensation of innocent plaintiffs, courts have developed additional tests for actual cause.

---

### Substantial Factor Test

The substantial factor test provides that the actual cause element is satisfied where (1) there are two or more successive or concurrent causes of plaintiff’s harm; (2) each defendant alone would have been enough to cause the plaintiff’s entire harm; and (3) plaintiff endures a single, indivisible harm.

**Joint and several liability** is available in situations where two or more defendants acting in concert or independently injure the plaintiff and damages cannot be allocated to a particular defendant. In this situation **all of the defendants are liable for the entirety of the plaintiff’s injury.** The plaintiff can execute against each defendant for the total damages suffered, although the plaintiff may only recover from any or all defendants an amount equal to the total damages awarded.

---

### Alternative Causation Test

The alternative causation test provides that when the “but-for” test does not work, the actual cause element is satisfied as to each defendant where (1) there are two or more defendants, all of whom are before the court; (2) all defendants breached their duty of care; (3) injury was caused by only one of the defendants;  and (4) it was impossible to tell from the facts which defendant caused the injury.

The burden shifts to the defendants to show that they were not the cause. If the defendants cannot do so, they will be jointly/severally liable.

*In such cases, the “but for” analysis does not work; remember the shotguns in the field.*

---

### Loss of Chance

This is a minority rule. The plaintiff must show that but for the medical malpractice, plaintiff would not have lost chance/died.

---

### Market Share Liability

If the harm was caused by a generic product and the plaintiff cannot show which of a large group of negligent defendants was responsible for manufacturing the product that caused her harm, the plaintiff can bring a claim of negligence against those who might have caused her harm, and each defendant is responsible based on its share of the market.

The burden shifts to the defendant to show that they could not have made the product that harmed the plaintiff (the defendant is severably liable).

*Several liability – X had 10% of the relative market; X will pay 10% of plaintiff’s damages unless X can show it could not have made the product that harmed P.*

---

## Proximate Cause

A defendant’s conduct is the proximate cause of an event if the event was foreseeable, and no intervening cause came between the defendant’s conduct and the event.

Proximate cause is not about causation – it is a policy analysis that asks whether it is fair to hold a defendant liable where that defendant is the actual cause of the plaintiff’s harm.

---

### Foreseeability

For defendant’s breach to be a proximate cause of plaintiff’s injury, first, the type of harm suffered by the plaintiff must be a foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s breaching conduct.

*Check whether eggshell plaintiff rule triggered!!*

---

### Intervening Acts

Four types of intervening acts are generally considered unforeseeable (although on the facts, they might be foreseeable). These are (1) acts of nature; (2) intentional torts of third parties; (3) criminal acts of third parties; and (4) gross negligence of third parties. Gross negligence is the “conscious and voluntary disregard of the need to use reasonable care.” It involves a greater degree of carelessness than ordinary negligence.

Generally, ordinary negligence by third parties is a foreseeable intervening cause. However, the foreseeability of all intervening acts (including the above) must be determined by a factual analysis.

---

# Damages

For a defendant to be liable for negligence, the plaintiff must show that there was a cognizable injury. A cognizable injury is harm recognized by law as sufficient to support a legal claim.

Legally compensable harm includes physical or emotional injury to the plaintiff, as well as injury to the plaintiff's property.

(1) The type of damage has to be foreseeable; (2) damages have to be reasonably certain; (3) the damages could not have been avoided.

Personal injury and property damages are recoverable for negligence. Nominal damages are not available for negligence.

The Due Process clause of the Constitution limits the amount of punitive damages available for negligence. Usually it can be about 10% of the wealth of the defendant.

---

### Compensatory Damages

Compensatory damages return the plaintiff to their pre-injury position. To be entitled to compensatory damages, (1) the **type** of damage must be foreseeable; (2) the damage must be reasonably certain (not speculative); and (3) the damage must be avoidable.

---

### Avoidable Consequences Rule

The plaintiff must take reasonable steps after injury to avoid increasing or exacerbating the injury.

---

### Special Damages

Special damages include medical costs, lost wages, and cost of repair. A plaintiff can recover past, present, and future damages. Future damages will be reduced to present value.

---

### Collateral Source Rule

The fact that plaintiff has insurance to cover some or all damages does not mean that defendant does not have to pay up. Defendant should not benefit from plaintiff’s foresight. Rule also applies to gratuitous services (e.g., spouse who provides caretaking for injured P).

---

### General Damages

General damages are intangible and difficult to measure. They include pain and suffering.

---

### Punitive Damages

Punitive damages are never recoverable just for negligent conduct. Defendant’s acts must be more culpable than negligence - like willful, malicious, or reckless.

The purpose of punitive damages is deterrance.

The wealth of the defendant is highly relevant here.

The Due Process Clause limits the amount of punitive damages. *Generally, more than 10% ratio to compensatory damages is considered to be unconstitutional.*

---

# Defenses for Negligence

There are certain defenses that the plaintiff may assert.

---

## Contributory Negligence

Contributory negligence is conduct by the plaintiff that falls below the applicable standard of care and that defendant can raise as a defense against plaintiff’s prima facie negligence claim. Similar to the prima facie case of negligence, contributory negligence requires proof that (1) plaintiff owed herself a duty of care; (2) plaintiff breached the duty owed; (3) plaintiff’s breach was the actual cause of plaintiff’s harm; (4) plaintiff’s breach was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s harm; and (5) plaintiff suffered legally compensable harm.

---

### Duty for Contributory Negligence

The reasonably prudent person standard may or may not apply to the contributory negligence analysis.

*If the reasonably prudent person standard applies, only breach and actual cause need to be analyzed.*

---

### Breach for Contributory Negligence

For contributory negligence, breach is determined through the application of the Carroll Towing test, which weighs the likelihood of harm due to the plaintiff’s breach and the potential gravity of harm due to the plaintiff’s breach against the plaintiff’s burden of taking precautions or engaging in alternative conduct. When the likelihood of harm and gravity of harm outweigh the burden, plaintiff has breached.

*See Carrol Towing analysis for breach above*

---

### Actual Cause for Contributory Negligence

The default test is “but for,” which for contributory negligence asks whether the plaintiff’s harm would have occurred absent the plaintiff’s breaching conduct. To satisfy this standard, plaintiff’s breach need not be the sole “but for” cause, just a “but for” cause, of plaintiff’s harm.

---

### Proximate Cause for Contributory Negligence

A defendant’s conduct is the proximate cause of an event if the event was foreseeable, and no intervening cause came between the defendant’s conduct and the event.

*Do foreseeability and intervening acts analysis (see above).*

---

### Damages for Contributory Negligence

In some jurisdictions, any fault by plaintiff bars recovery.

---

### One Last Clear Chance Doctrine

Some jurisdictions follow the **one last clear chance doctrine**. *In a multiple choice question this is generally the wrong answer!* Under this doctrine, if the defendant’s negligence occurs after plaintiff’s negligence, so that defendant had the last opportunity to avoid the harm, then plaintiff is entitled to full recovery.

---

### Comparative Fault for Contributory Negligence

The plaintiff can recover no matter how much the plaintiff is at fault. Recovery is the amount of damages minus the percentage that plaintiff is at fault.

*Assume pure comparative fault where joint and several liability applies unless told otherwise.*

---

### Modified Comparative Fault for Contributory Negligence

The plaintiff is barred from recovery if the plaintiff is as much at fault or more at fault than the defendant. If the plaintiff is less at fault than the defendant, the plaintiff can recover the percentage of their damages corresponding to the percentage of the defendant's fault.

*For example, if plaintiff is 60% at fault, plaintiff is barred from recovery. If plaintiff is 40% at fault, then plaintiff would recover 60% of plaintiff’s damages.*

---

### Assumption of Risk

There is assumption of risk where the plaintiff, orally or in writing, relieves defendant of responsibility to be non-negligent.

This is typically done through a waiver that accompanies athletic activities and recreational sports.

Assumption of risk is not allowed for necessities. For example, if a landlord rents an apartment or a hospital provides care.

A plaintiff may impliedly assume the risk.

---

## Vicarious Liability

Vicarious liability is a doctrine under which an employer can be held liable for the negligence of its employees. In order for an employer to be vicariously liable, (1) the tortfeasor must be an employee of the employer, and (2) the tortfeasor must have acted in the scope of employment.

*If the instructions say to assume that [employee] was an employee of [employer] and that [he/she/they] acted negligently, only the second element – whether [employee] acted negligently in the scope of [his/her/their] employment – needs to be analyzed.*

---

### Negligence for Vicarious Liability

An employee acted negligently in the scope of their employment if they commit a tort within the scope of employment when performing a service in furtherance of the employer’s business.

*See if going and coming rule is triggered*

---

### Independent Contractors for Vicarious Liability

An employer is not vicariously liable for torts committed by independant contractors. Independant contractor status depends on whether the employer who hired dictates the means, method, and manner of the independant contractor's work. The more control exercised, the more likely the person is an employee and not an independant contractor.

---

### Parent Child for Vicarious Liability

Parents are not generally vicariously liable for torts of the child absent a statute saying otherwise. Parents can be liable for their own negligence, negligent supervision, or entrustment.

---

### Going and Coming Rule

When a tort occurs during an employee’s commute to or from work, the Going and Coming rule determines whether the employee was acting in furtherance of the employer’s business at the time. The rule states that an employee going to and from work is ordinarily not acting in furtherance of the employer’s business because they are outside the time and space restrictions of their employment. Therefore, generally, the employer is not vicariously liable for a tort that occurs during an employee’s commute to or from work.

However, there are exceptions to the Going and Coming rule.

---

### Incidental Benefit Exception to Going and Coming Rule

Incidental Benefit is an exception to the Going and Coming rule. Where the trip involves an incidental benefit to employer that is not common to the commute of ordinary members of the work force, the Going and Coming rule does not apply and the employee acts within the scope of employment.

---

### Dual Purpose Exception to Going and Coming Rule

Dual Purpose Doctrine is an exception to the Going and Coming rule. An employer is vicariously liable if, in addition to going home or to work, an employee is performing some work-related task.[^9]

[^9]:From professor’s rubric (watch out because very fact specific but also law): Although plausible, dual purpose is not the strongest argument here because (1) this scenario does not fit the mold of a standard dual purpose exception to the Going and Coming rule because it does not involve the employee performing an additional discrete task while commuting (e.g., picking up tools at the employer’s request on the way to/from work); and (2) the dual purpose analysis relates directly to the employee’s tort (i.e., speeding), rather than to some separate act (e.g., completing an expense report in the Edgewater case). Courts are less likely to glean a dual purpose from the tortious conduct, as tortious conduct is arguably always against the interests of an employer.

---

### Special Hazard Exception to Going and Coming Rule

Special Hazard is an exception to the Going and Coming rule. An employer is vicariously liable when the employee’s commute involves a special hazard.

---

### Frolic and Detour

An employee acts within the scope of employment when she commits a tort while performing service in furtherance of the employer’s business. The frolic and detour rules apply to factual scenarios where an employee leaves work during work hours.

The frolic rule states that an employee acts outside the scope of employment when, during work hours, the employee goes to a place not associated with work for a purpose not associated with work and commits a tort then.

The detour rule states that an employee acts within the scope of employment if, during work hours, the employee makes a slight departure from work and commits a tort then.

To distinguish between frolic and detour, courts consider (1) the length of time of departure; (2) physical distance of departure from place or route assigned or expected to be used; and (3) the extent to which the employee was at the time secondarily accomplishing the purpose of employment.

---

# Strict Liability

In tort law, there are two broad categories of activities for which a plaintiff may be held strictly liable. These are possession of certain animals and abnormally dangerous activities.  Additionally, in the area of torts known as products liability, there is a sub-category known as strict products liability which applies when a defective product for which an appropriate defendant holds responsibility causes injury to an appropriate plaintiff.

If a defendant is strictly liable for injuring a plaintiff, the plaintiff does not have to show proof of fault.

---

### Possession of Wild Animals

If defendant keeps a wild animal and plaintiff gets injured because it does something characteristic of that animal, keeper is strictly liable no matter how unforeseeable the harm.

*For example, even if a pet tiger has always been gentle, owner is going to be held strictly liable if the tiger bites off a plaintiff's hand.*

---

### Domestic Pet Rule

“Every dog gets one free bite.” The defendant is not liable unless the defendant knows the dog is dangerous.

---

### Abnormally Dangerous Activities

An activity is abnormally dangerous when (1) there is a high risk of serious harm to others; (2) the defendant cannot engage in the activity without risk, and cannot eliminate the risk with care; and (3) the activity is not commonly undertaken in the community.

**Proximate Cause:** plaintiff must be injured by the risk that makes the activity dangerous.

The plaintiff can recover unless they were also at fault.

---

### Defenses to Strict Liability

A defendant can bring various defenses against strict liability.

---

### Contributory Negligence for Strict Liability

A defendant generally cannot raise the contributory negligence defense with strict liability, except where plaintiff knew of the danger that justified the imposition of strict liability, and the plaintiff's action caused exactly that danger to manifest. Here, plaintiff could be said to have assumed the risk, and plaintiff is completely barred from recovery.

---

# Products Liability

In tort law, products liability holds any party who manufactures or sells a defective product liable for damage caused by that product. Parties include the manufacturer, manufacturers of component parts, assembly company, wholesaler, and retail store owner. This does not include services or occasional sellers. A consumer, including those who borrowed a product or received it as a gift, can bring a products liability claim for harm caused by products containing inherent defects. Products are tangible personal property and intangible personal property such as gas, natural entities including pets and plants, real estate, and writings including navigational charts. Defects are manufacturing defect, design defect or inadequate warning (marketing defect).

To prove a prima facie case of products liability, the plaintiff has to show that (1) the defendant sold the product that the plaintiff used; (2) the defendant was the commercial seller of the product; (3) the plaintiff suffered an injury; (4) the item was defective when the defendant sold it; and (5) the defect was an actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury

Products liability claims can be based on negligence, strict liability, or breach of warranty of fitness. This will typically depend on the jurisdiction within which the claim is based, due to the fact that there is no federal products liability law.

---

### Proper Context for Products Liability

Generally services alone are not enough. When both a product and services are present, the goods or product must dominate.

A **proper plaintiff** is any plaintiff who is a user, consumer, or bystander physically injured by a defective product. **No requirement of contract privity.**

A **proper defendant** is a commercial supplier at all levels of the distribution chain and in the market selling the product, including manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer. This does not include occasional sellers and those supplying services.

*For example, if a beauty salon applies a perm manufactured by PermaCo causing plaintiff to go bald, beauty salon is strictly liable. This is different from a dentist using a defective needle.*

---

### Defect

Almost all jurisdictions impose strict liability where the product is in an unreasonably dangerous defective condition. Formulations of liability occur under 3 categories of defect. These are **Manufacturing Defect**, **Design Defect**, and **Inadequate Warning**.

---

### Manufacturing Defect

To show that there was a manufacturing defect, the plaintiff must show that (1) the product is in a condition not intended by the manufacturer and; (2) the defect existed when it left the manufacturer’s hands.

---

### Design Defect

To show that there was a design defect, the plaintiff must show that the product was as intended by manufacturer but still presented a danger of personal injury or property damage to the plaintiff because of a flawed design. There are two tests for design defect.

The **ordinary consumer expectation test:** If the product is more dangerous than would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who possesses ordinary knowledge common to the community, the defendant is liable for design defect.

Courts use the **Risk-Utility Balancing Test** to determine whether the danger the design threatens (cost in human injury and property damage), outweighs its utility to society. Product will be found defective if an alternative design could have reduced the danger at about the same cost.

*Think of how easy it would be to change design, likelihood of harm, gravity of harm, and utility of product.

---

### Inadequate Warning

A plaintiff can bring a strict products liability claim on the basis that the warning was inadequate. Courts use a reasonableness test, which asks if the warning reasonably informs a reader of the risks of the product and how to reduce them. *Look at language, placement, size of font, and clarity.*

---

### No Warning

A manufacturer has a duty to warn about risks of which it knows or should know. Courts consider the gravity and probability of harm.

*If there is 1% risk of death – they should warn; if there is 1% risk of tooth discoloration – probably not.*

---

### Causation for Strict Products Liability

**Actual cause:** Usually proven by showing that the defect that injured plaintiff was in existence at the time it left defendant’s control.

**Proximate cause:** Look for superseding causes which might break the chain of causation. For instance, did plaintiff use/alter the product in an unforeseeable way?

**Learned intermediary doctrine:** If a manufacturer provides a warning to a doctor, the manufacturer can expect that the doctor will pass the warning on to the patient. If the doctor does not, the doctor is a superseding cause of the patient’s harm.

---

### Damages for Strict Products Liability

Recoverable when there is personal injury or property damage other than to the product itself. Where the harm is only to the product itself, the only claim is breach of warranty.

---

### Defenses for Strict Products Liability

There are various defenses for strict products liability.

---

### Misuse

If the plaintiff’s use of the product is neither intended nor foreseeable, the defendant may have a defense. If the misuse was foreseeable, the defendant may be held liable for foreseeable misuse.

---

### Alteration

If the product was altered or modified between the time the product leaves the manufacturer’s control and the time of plaintiff’s injury, the manufacturer may not be strictly liable.

---

### Assumption of the Risk for Strict Products Liability

If plaintiff has used the product with knowledge of the risk, the defendant may not be strictly liable for the product.

---

### Contributory Negligence for Strict Products Liability

At modern law, contributory negligence only applies as a defense to strict products liability if the plaintiff’s conduct rises to the level of misuse, abnormal use, or independent negligence.

If there are no practicable alternatives to such use, a plaintiff’s continued use of a product which the plaintiff knows to be defective is not voluntary, and thus not an assumption of the risk.

Where a defendant can show that his product was subsequently altered in an unforeseeable manner by someone in the chain of distribution or a third party, courts usually relieve that defendant of liability.

---

### Comparative Negligence for Strict Products Liability

Some jurisdictions that have adopted a comparative negligence system as to negligence also apply that system to strict liability. A plaintiff’s wrongful conduct that contributes, along with the defective product to his own injury reduces his recovery in some amount. This is usually limited to misuse, abnormal use, or independent negligence situations (i.e., not where the plaintiff’s wrongful conduct is a failure to discover the defect). In some jurisdictions that permit comparative fault, the plaintiff’s unreasonable conduct in failing to discover and guard against the defect is not a defense.

---

### Products Liability on Negligence Theory

Any foreseeable plaintiff can bring an action.

*Analyze the conduct of each defendant and ask whether defendant acted reasonably. (This is different from strict products liability, which focuses on the product, not the actions of the defendant.)*

Res Ipsa Loquitur takes the place of manufacturing defect in negligence theory.

All negligence defenses apply.

---

### Products Liability on Warranty Theory

An express Warranty exists where defendant makes a specific representation as to the quality or nature of the product that becomes a basis of the bargain. Any seller can make this warranty (manufacturer, distributor, seller). The warranty can occur via advertising, during negotiations, or as a contract provision.

---

### Implied Warranty or Warranty of Merchantability

If a merchant deals in goods of a particular kind, the sale of such goods constitutes an implied warranty that those goods will be merchantable (i.e. the goods are of average quality for goods of that kind and are generally fit for the purpose for which such goods are normally used).

There must be privity and notice. The implied warranty can be disclaimed by contract. Where harm is to the product itself, the only claim a plaintiff can pursue is for warranty.

---

# Nuisance

A nuisance can be public or private.

---

### Public Nuisance

A public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public (for example, health, safety, and morals of community).

A public nuisance claim is typically brought by a government actor such as an attorney general.

To recover damages as an individual, one must have suffered harm different from that suffered by other members of the public.

---

### Private Nuisance

A private nuisance is a thing or activity that substantially and unreasonably interferes with a plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the plaintiff’s land.

A private nuisance is usually an intentional tort, because once a defendant is placed on notice that defendant is interfering, and defendant still does not stop, they are acting intentionally.

Courts do a five-factor balancing test to determine whether interference was substantial and unreasonable. They look at (1) the value of defendant’s activity; (2) whether there are alternatives; (3) the nature of locality; (4) the extent of plaintiff’s injury; and (5) who was there first (used to be a defense now just a factor).

For remedy of injunction (equitable relief), plaintiff must show that plaintiff is suffering or will suffer irreparable harm, and damages are an inadequate remedy. Judge will then do balancing test.

---

# Defamation

Defamation is a statement that injures a third party's reputation. The tort of defamation includes both libel (written statements) and slander (spoken statements). State common law and statutory law governs defamation actions, and each state varies in their standards for defamation and potential damages. Defamation is a tricky area of law as the lines between stating an opinion versus a fact can be vague, and defamation tests the limits of the first amendment freedoms of speech and press.

To prove prima facie defamation, a plaintiff must show four things. These are (1) a false statement purporting to be fact; (2) publication or communication of that statement to a third person; (3) fault amounting to at least negligence; and (4) damages, or some harm caused to the reputation of the person or entity who is the subject of the statement.[^9]

In addition to the defendant who originated the defamatory message, other persons who republish the defamatory message are potentially liable as well.

[^9]:Legal Information Institute, Cornell University. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defamation](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defamation)

---

### Standard of Proof for Public and Private Figures

| Public Official | Public Figure | Private Figure |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Acting in public capacity | Household names and people injecting themselves into controversy | If public concern, plaintiff must show negligence |
| Actual malice by clear and convincing evidence | Actual malice by clear and convincing evidence | If private concern, no actual malice needed but not settled law |

---

### Libel v Slander

Libel is a defamatory message embodied in any relative permanent form. Reputational harm is presumed, but the damages have to be proven.

Slander is defamation in spoken rather than written form.

To recover, plaintiff must prove special damages (specific economic losses that flow from the slander). plaintiff can also receive reputational damages.

Slander per se is slander which imputes to plaintiff behavior or characteristics that are incompatible with the proper conduct of plaintiff’s business, profession, or office; slander that imputes to plaintiff commission of a crime involving moral turpitude or infamous punishment (prison/death); allegations that plaintiff has some loathsome disease; and falsely imputing lack of chastity to a woman.

---

### Defenses to Defamation Claims

**Truth** is widely accepted as a complete defense to all defamation claims.

**Absolute Privilege** is a complete defense to a defamation claim. This privilege can be asserted in communications between spouses; statements made on the floor of the legislature; communications between high ranking executive officials; and statements made in conduct of judicial proceedings. The privilege ends if someone repeats in a non-privileged situation.

**Qualified Privilege** permits someone to make a statement that would typically be considered defamatory, but because of particular circumstances, a particular statement made would not be considered to be defamatory. However, if the statement is made with actual malice, then the speaker will no longer be entitled to the qualified privilege. The particular circumstances can include comments reasonably necessary to protect or advance the defendant’s own legitimate interests; comments communicated on a matter of interest to the recipient of the communication or a third person; or comments communicated concerning a matter of public interest to one empowered to protect that interest.

A defendant will lose privilege if they have a bad intent, acts out of malice, or is reckless as to the statement’s truth or falsity, or does not believe the truth of the defamatory communication.

**Public Official:** If defamation is related to capacity as a public official, plaintiff must prove actual malice by clear and convincing evidence (higher standard than preponderance of the evidence).

A Public figure is treated just like a public official. Same standard of clear and convincing evidence.

If the subject matter of the defamation is a matter of public concern, defendant must be shown to have exhibited some degree of fault higher than strict liability, which presumably means negligence.

Private Concern: plaintiff does not have to prove actual malice to get presumed or punitive damages (note - not settled; not tested).

---

# Other Torts

There are other torts.

---

## Invasion of Privacy

There is an invasion of privacy if a defendant unreasonably intrudes into plaintiff’s seclusion (zone of privacy). The intrusion must be highly objectionable to a reasonable person (e.g. wiretapping, stalking).

Damages include compensatory damages, and, if bad enough, punitive damages.

---

### Use of Name Voice or Likeness

Unauthorized use of plaintiff’s name, voice, or likeness for defendant’s commercial advantage. Newsworthy purpose of plaintiff’s likeness or identity is exempt.

---

### Public Disclosure of Private True Facts

To show public disclosure of private true facts, a plaintiff must prove that the disclosure would be highly offensive to a reasonable person and not newsworthy.

*Look for passage of time – 20 years pass and facts are less relevant.*

Need some sort of publication or dissemination of information.

Injunction is possible because the information is true (unlike defamation).

If the defendant got the information from public records, defendant cannot be liable for sharing that information.

----

### Portrayal in False Light

To bring a torts claim for portrayal in false light, the plaintiff must show that the defendant published matters portraying plaintiff in a false light.

The plaintiff must show (1) publication; (2) false information; (3) divulging of information is highly offensive to reasonable person; and (4) some level of fault (parallel to defamation rules – actual malice, etc.).

---

### Wrongful Institution of Legal Proceedings

**Malicious prosecution** is a tort where criminal proceedings were instituted by defendant for an improper purpose and without probable cause, that terminate favorably for plaintiff and cause plaintiff damages. Plaintiff must prevail on the merits.

**Wrongful institution of civil proceedings** is a tort similar to malicious prosecution.

**Abuse of Process** is a tort where defendant intentionally misuses a judicial process (civil or criminal) for a purpose other than that for which it was intended. Also similar to malicious prosecution.

---

## Economic Torts

There are economic torts.

---

### Intentional Misrepresentation


To show intentional misrepresentation, the plaintiff must prove (1) intentional material misrepresentation by the defendant (2) of past or present fact (3) made with knowledge and
(4) on which the plaintiff justifiably relies to plaintiff’s economic detriment.

Misrepresentation can be a false, affirmative assertion of fact (engine is new) or an active concealment (roll back odometer). Failure to disclose is not enough unless (1) there is a fiduciary relationship; (2) there is an ambiguous or misleading statement that causes reliance; (3) defendant makes an assertion, believing it is true, but then discovers it was false (or circumstances changed) and defendant fails to disclose; (5) defendant makes a false assertion not intending reliance but discovers plaintiff relied; or (6) plaintiff reasonably expects there would be disclosure.

Mental state is key. Defendant must intend plaintiff (or class of persons which plaintiff belongs) to rely (will act or fail to act in reliance on defendant’s misrepresentation).

Scienter present when defendant knew statement was false or is reckless as to veracity.[^10]

[^10]:Scienter is a legal term that refers to the intent or knowledge of wrongdoing. In the context of law, scienter denotes that a party had knowledge of the falsity or fraudulent nature of a statement or action, and acted with the intent to deceive or defraud another party. It is often a key element in cases involving fraud, securities violations, and other misconduct where proving intent is crucial to establishing liability. The term "scienter" comes from Latin. It is derived from the Latin word "sciens," which means "knowing," the present participle of "scire," which means "to know." The suffix "-ter" is an adverbial suffix in Latin, so "scienter" essentially means "knowingly" or "with knowledge."

---

### Negligent Misrepresentation

Under torts law, a defendant has no duty to avoid negligent infliction of pure economic loss unless there is a special relationship, like a fiduciary duty, or if the defendant knows that they are acting for the benefit of a third party, and that third party relies on the defendant's actions and suffers economic loss.

---

### Interference with Contractual Relations

Interference with contractual relations is a tort. To show interference with contractual relations, the plaintiff must prove that (1) the defendant knew that there is a contract between plaintiff and a third party; and (2) the defendant acted with the purpose of having the contract breached or making it harder to perform.

---

### Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage

Interference with prospective economic advantage is a tort. To prevail, a plaintiff must show that the defendant (1) knew of prospective economic advantage; and (2) acted to interfere with it for improper motives. A defendant can act to protect their own competitive interests.
