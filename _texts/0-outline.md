A tort is an act or omission that gives rise to injury or harm[^1] to another and amounts to a civil wrong for which courts impose liability.

Torts claims are governed by common law and state statutory law. Judges have wide latitude in determining which actions qualify as legally cognizable wrongs, which defenses may override any given claim, and the appropriate measure of damages. Although tort law varies by state, many courts utilize the Restatement of Torts (2nd) as an influential guide.

Torts fall into three general categories. These are (1) **intentional torts**; (2)  **negligent torts**; and (3) strict liability torts (e.g., liability for making and selling defective products or products liability).[^2]

[^1]:In the context of torts, "injury" describes the invasion of any legal right, whereas "harm" describes a loss or detriment that an individual suffers.

## Approach for torts questions

1.	Is this torts (not criminal law or something else)?
2.	Who is the plaintiff?
3.	Who is the defendant?
4.	What is the harm?
5.	What legal theories can the plaintiff assert?

---

## Intentional Torts

Intentional torts are wrongs that the defendant knew or should have known would result through their actions or omissions. Elements of intentional torts are (1) voluntary act; (2) intent; (3) causation; and (4) harm.

---

## Voluntary Act

A voluntary act is an act performed consciously or willingly. A purely reflexive act in not a voluntary act.

---

## Intent

Under torts law, there is intent if the defendant either desired the act to cause a harmful result (purpose intent); or knew with substantial certainty that such a result would occur (knowledge intent).

If the defendant acted with necessary intent to inflict certain intentional torts against a person, but instead caused injury to another person, the defendant’s intent is transferred to the injured person. Transferred intent only applies to (1) battery, (2) assault, (3) false imprisonment, (4) trespass to land, and (5) trespass to chattels.

---

## Causation for Intentional Torts

There is causation if the defendant’s act or a force set in motion by the defendant caused the plaintiff’s injury.

---

## Harm for Intentional Torts

Varies based on the kind of tort. *Ways to establish harm: (1) establish elements of the tort; (2) prove specific injury.*

Liability for an intentional tort requires that there are no applicable privileges or defenses.

---

## Battery

A person is liable for the intentional tort of battery if they intentionally cause harmful or offensive contact with another person or with something closely connected to the other person. For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant either (1) desired to cause an immediate harmful or offensive contact; or (2) knew that such contact was substantially certain to occur.

A harmful contact of battery is contact causing physical impairment or injury. An offensive contact of battery is a contact that makes a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities feel threatened.

Even if the plaintiff doesn’t suffer actual damages, they can claim nominal damages. Thus, their proof of actual harm is not required in a battery. If a defendant acts with malice (e.g., deliberate disregard of a high probability of harm), the plaintiff may claim punitive damages. For unforeseen consequences, the defendant may still be liable under the “eggshell rule.”

*The injured person does not need to be aware of the contact (unlike assault).*

*The plaintiff does not have to prove injury; will get compensatory damages just by showing the elements.*

*Watch out for Privileges and defenses – **consent** comes up a lot in the context of battery.*

---

## Assault

A person is liable for the intentional tort of assault if they intentionally cause a person to be in reasonable apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact. For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant either (1) desired to cause an immediate harmful or offensive contact or the reasonable apprehension of such contact; or (2) knew that such a result was substantially certain to occur. It does not matter if the goal of the actor was merely to scare the victim or if the act was meant as a joke. The actor need not have intended for the contact to be harmful or offensive, only to have intended the actual contact.

For a person to have a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact, the person must have a reasonable belief that the act will lead to imminent harmful or offensive contact. The plaintiff must show that a reasonable person in the same position as the plaintiff would have experienced the same apprehension. If the apprehension is reasonable, it doesn’t matter whether D could actually carry out the threat. *For instance, brandishing an unloaded gun can still be assault.*

The victim does not need to prove fear, only that they were aware that such a contact might occur. If the victim and the tortfeasor do not know each other, then the legal standard is what an ordinary reasonable person under the same circumstances as the victim would have believed.

If the victim and tortfeasor have special knowledge of each other, this special knowledge may be considered when determining whether the victim’s apprehension was reasonable.

“Imminent” in the context of assault, means the threatened harmful or offensive contact must be certain or likely to occur very soon.

“Harmful or offensive” in the context of assault, is an objective standard referring to touching that is likely to or capable of causing harm or offending a reasonable person by violating prevailing social standards of acceptable touching.

An otherwise inoffensive contact may be deemed offensive if the tortfeasor knew the victim was unusually averse to such a contact.

There is some disagreement among jurisdictions in regard to the role of consent.

*Look for words that negate intent. For example, “If it weren’t a tort, I would punch you in the face.” These negate the intent and you won’t be able to say there was a tort.*

*Words alone rarely create an assault.*

Assault is typically paired with battery as assault and battery. In assault and battery, assault refers to the act that causes the victim to immediately apprehend a harmful or offensive contact, whereas battery refers to the act that causes the actual contact. * Some jurisdictions label assault as attempted battery.*

For imminent battery, battery must be able to occur almost instantly.

---

## False Imprisonment

A person commits false imprisonment when they intentionally confine another person in a restricted area against the confined person’s will and the confined person knows of the confinement or is injured by it. False imprisonment is an intentional tort.

For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant either (1) desired to confine or restrain the confined person in a restricted area; or (2) knew that such confinement was virtually certain to result.

Confinement can consist of physical barriers, threats of force, failing to release the confined person after a duty to release arises, or the invalid assertion of legal authority.

There is no duration requirement. For there to be false imprisonment, the confinement can be very brief.

If the confined person has actual knowledge of a reasonable means of escape, then there is no confinement and no liability. A reasonable means of escape is one where there is no threat of harm to the confined person or their property, and will not expose the confined person to risk of embarrassment.

The confinement must be against the confined person’s will. Consent is a defense to false imprisonment.

If the harmed person was aware of the confinement, they are entitled to any damages the jury finds appropriate.

If the harmed person was unaware of the confinement, they can only claim damages if they were injured by the confinement.

---

## Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress

A person commits intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) when they intentionally or recklessly act in a manner that causes another person to suffer severe emotional distress. IIED is an intentional tort.

For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with a desire to cause severe emotional distress or knew that such severe emotional distress was virtually certain to occur.

For there to be recklessness, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted in conscious disregard of a high degree of probability that their actions would cause the plaintiff severe emotional distress.

Extreme and outrageous conduct is conduct that exceeds all bounds tolerated by civilized society. Offensive or insulting language generally not enough, except when the defendant (1) is a common carrier or innkeeper; (2) knows of the plaintiff’s particular sensitivity; or (3) is an authority figure using racial or ethnic slurs against a subordinate.

The emotional distress must be severe. Severe emotional distress is emotional distress greater than a reasonable person would be expected to endure.

The severe emotional distress must be long lasting as opposed to transitory.

---

## Trespass to Land

A person is liable for trespass to land if they physically invade or cause an object or a third party to physically invade another person’s land. Trespass to land is an intentional tort. Instead of intent to trespass, there must be an intent to enter or remain on the land. The trespasser does not have to know that the land is owned or possessed by another person. The owner or possessor of the land does not have to prove that they suffered actual damages.

To show intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant either (1) desired to enter the land or cause something to enter the land, or (2) knew that land entry was substantially certain to result.

Mistake is not a defense to trespass to land.

Anyone in possession of the land can bring a trespass to land claim (landowner, tenant, adverse possessor).

Remedies include damages including nominal damages. The defendant is liable for the full extent of harm caused by the trespass.

The plaintiff can also seek the restitutionary remedy of ejectment in order to have the defendant removed from the land.

---

## Trespass to Chattels

A person is liable for trespass to chattels if they intentionally deprive or prevent another person from using their legally possessed personal property (chattel). Trespass to chattels is an intentional tort.

For there to be intent, the plaintiff must show that the defendant intentionally performed the physical act that interfered with the plaintiff’s chattel. Interference is using or borrowing another person’s chattel without their permission. For trespass to chattels, the intent to trespass is not required. Mistake is not a defense.

There must be actual damage, but it does not need to be actual damage to the chattel itself. Actual damages include the value of loss of use of the chattel during a dispossession or the cost to remedy an intermeddling. If the intermeddling with a chattel is harmless, there is no trespass to chattel.  

Remedies include damages such as cost of repair, fair market rental value, as well as punitive damages if the defendant is a particularly bad actor (willful, wanton, or malicious conduct).

Replevin is a legal action that allows a person to recover personal property of which they were wrongfully dispossessed. A writ of replevin orders the defendant to return property to its rightful owner. [^3]

[^3]:"replevin" comes from the Old French word "replevir," which means "to recover or take back." It is derived from the Latin word "replegere," which means "to take back or regain."

---

## Conversion

A person is liable for conversion if they intentionally exercise dominion or control over or cause the destruction of or serious and substantial interference with another person’s chattel.

Mistake is not a defense. A defendant is liable for conversion even if acting in good faith.

Destruction or Serious and Substantial Interference is the exercise by the defendant of dominion and control over the chattel.

*Interference with plaintiff’s property interest is more significant than trespass to chattel. Longer period of interference and greater use by defendant leads to conversion.*

Remedies include forced sale (common), where the price will be the fair market value at the time the chattel was converted, and replevin.

---

| Trespass to Chattels | Conversion |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Intentional tort | Intentional tort |
| Committed by intentionally dispossessing or intermeddling with a chattel in the possession of another. | Committed by intentionally exercising dominion or control over a chattel and seriously interfering with the rights of the owner. |
| Defendant is liable for damage or diminished value of chattel. | Defendant is liable for the full value of the chattel at the time of the conversion. |

---

## Defenses and Privileges to Intentional Torts

In tort law, privileges are often used as defenses. So, when we say "defense of others" is a privilege, we also imply it is a defense because the defendant is using the privilege as a reason to avoid liability.

---

## Consent

Consent is usually a defense for battery and assault.

---

## Express Consent

Under torts law, express consent is when a plaintiff affirmatively communicates permission for a defendant to act. Express consent is limited by reasonability, meaning that the defendant’s actions cannot exceed the scope of the consent.

---

## Implied consent

Under torts law, implied consent exists if a reasonable person would interpret the plaintiff’s conduct as giving the defendant permission to act.

*For example, if a person is elbowed and hurt while playing basketball, even if the elbowing was intentional, the defendant had impliedly consented to being elbowed by agreeing to play a game where elbowing tends to happen and is foreseeable.*

Mistake can negate consent **when it goes to the consequences or nature of the act**.

*For example, if woman brings tort claim against man for giving her STD and before having sex had asked man if he had STD and man had said no I don’t so woman agreed to not use protection, woman has a tort claim because mistake about man’s STD status went to heart of claim.*

---

## Self-Defense

Self-defense is a defense in torts law against charges of assault, battery and other intentional torts. Self-defense in torts allows a person to use reasonable and proportionate force to protect themselves from imminent harm, provided their belief in the necessity of such force is reasonable.
The defendant must have a reasonable belief that they were in imminent danger.

The force used in self-defense must be proportionate to the threat.

The threat must be imminent and not a future or past threat.  

Deadly force cannot be used in response to a non-deadly threat.

In some jurisdictions there is a duty to retreat before using deadly force if it is safe to do so. However, this duty does not apply in one's own home (the "castle doctrine").

---

## Defense of Others

In an intentional torts claim a defendant can assert the privilege of defense of others. Under this privilege, a defendant is entitled to defend another from attack to the same extent that the other person is lawfully entitled to defend themselves. However, the defendant is liable if they acted by mistake.

---

## Defense of Property

In an intentional torts claim a defendant can assert the privilege of defense of property. Under this privilege, a defendant can use reasonable force to defend real or personal property. A defendant may never use deadly force to protect personal or real property.

*Look for situations that start with defense of property and escalate to become defense of self or others.*

A defendant may use reasonable force to eject a trespasser after asking them to leave.

A defendant may use reasonable, non-deadly force may be used to recapture chattels (get back own personal property) if the person seeking to recapture requests its return first or a request would be futile; and defendant is in hot pursuit.

*For example, if Billy took Charlie’s jacket, Charlie asked for it back, Billy ran off with the jacket, Charlie can chase Billy and use reasonable force to get the jacket back.*

---

## Authority Privilege

In an intentional torts claim a defendant can assert the privilege of authority. Under this privilege, a police officer can arrest a person if they reasonably believe the person committed a felony; a police officer can arrest a person for a misdemeanor if the person breached the peace. A private person making a “citizen’s arrest” does not have the privilege of authority, and if their belief is wrong they are liable for tort.

---

## Shopkeepers Privilege

A shopkeeper is not liable for false imprisonment if they had a reasonable suspicion that the defendant stole something from the shop. A shopkeeper can only detain a person for a reasonable amount of time and in a reasonable manner on the premises or immediate vicinity.

---

## Parent Teacher Discipline Privilege

A parent or teacher may use reasonable force to discipline a child.

---

## Necessity Privilege

A defendant may damage a plaintiff’s property if such damage is reasonably necessary to avoid a substantially greater harm to the public, self, or the defendant’s property.

---

## Public Necessity

In tort law, the public necessity defense can be used against charges of trespass or conversion where a defendant reasonably believes interference with a plaintiff’s property is necessary to prevent an imminent emergency situation. The defendant must reasonably believe that the emergency cannot be prevented in some other reasonable way, and must also use reasonable care to avoid causing greater harm than the harm that was averted.

Public necessity serves as an absolute defense, meaning that a defendant will not be liable for any damages caused by its trespass or conversion.

---

## Private Necessity

Private necessity is a defense in tort law against charges of trespass in situations where defendants have interfered with the plaintiff's property in an emergency to advance or protect their own interests. The privilege of private necessity must be exercised at a reasonable time, in a reasonable manner, and in light of all the circumstances. The property owner owes a duty of reasonable care under the circumstances.

Private necessity does not serve as an absolute defense to liability for trespass. A defendant who commits trespass and invokes the defense of private necessity must still pay for any harm done to the property caused by the trespass. However, the defendant is not liable for nominal or punitive damages.

If the emergency which caused the defendant to commit trespass on the plaintiff's property continues, the defendant is entitled to remain on the plaintiff's land and cannot be ejected as long as the emergency continues.

---

## Negligence

To bring a cause of action for negligence, the plaintiff has to prove (1) that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care; (2) that the defendant breached that duty; (3) causation (both actual cause and proximate cause); and (4) damages.

OR

Negligence is conduct that falls below the applicable standard of care. A prima facie negligence claim requires that (1) defendant owed plaintiff a duty of care; (2) defendant breached the duty owed; (3) defendant’s breach was the factual cause of plaintiff’s harm; (4) defendant’s breach was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s harm; and (5) plaintiff suffered legally compensable harm.

---

## Duty

Under torts law, people do not generally have an affirmative duty to protect others. However, a defendant generally owes a duty to foreseeable plaintiffs. To be a foreseeable plaintiff, the plaintiff must be within the zone of danger created by defendant’s conduct. To determine whether plaintiff is in the zone of danger, courts consider the relationship between plaintiff and defendant, the time and space between plaintiff and defendant’s breach, and other facts relevant to whether plaintiff was foreseeable.[^4]

[^4]:Rule from Core spring 2024: the test for foreseeability is whether the defendant could reasonably predict that their actions might cause harm to someone.

---

## Rescuer

A defendant has a duty to act if they volunteered to protect the plaintiff from harm, possibly preventing others from protecting the plaintiff. The omission of actions may be negligent when the defendant had a duty to act. If an individual voluntarily initiates a rescue attempt, that individual has a duty to complete the rescue to the extent reasonably possible, especially if the person in need of rescue reasonably relied on the individual who initiated the rescue attempt. Nonprofessional rescuers are foreseeable plaintiff’s as a matter of policy and can recover against the negligent party creating the need.

If a defendant's tortious conduct creates the need to rescue, the defendant has a duty to rescue plaintiffs endangered by that conduct.

Generally, there is no duty to rescue another person unless the defendant has voluntarily undertaken the rescue. In some jurisdictions, a person who initially undertakes a rescue may cease acting so long as the endangered person is not left in a worse position than she would have been in had the undertaking never been initiated. This is contrary to the majority view, which requires a person undertaking a rescue to act reasonably.

Many states have good samaritan statutes that protect a rescuer unless she is reckless or engages in intentional wrongdoing.

*Special relationship of dependence or mutual dependence (carrier/passenger, inn keeper/guest, captain/passengers, drinking buddies).*

---

## Duty to Control Third Parties

Generally there is no duty to control the conduct of a third party to prevent harm to another. However, a special relationship between the defendant and a third party may create a duty to control a third party’s conduct.

---

## Providers of Alcohol

Under the traditional rule, a provider of alcohol is not responsible for DUI injuries.

The Dram Shop Acts impose liability on establishments when they know or should know that a patron is drunk and that person drives while intoxicated and harms a third party. The Dram Shop Acts do not apply to social hosts, but only to those who are licensed to sell alcohol.

---

## Therapist

A therapist who becomes aware that her patient presents a specific, credible threat of physical violence to **a specific person** has an affirmative duty to warn that specific person. *This is not a duty that requires a full analysis so don’t do breach or causation.*

---

## Negligent Entrustment

A defendant can be liable for negligent entrustment if they give something dangerous to a person they know or should know is not competent to handle it (for example, giving a gun to a small child).

---

## Duty to Protect Third Parties

A special relationship between the defendant and a third party may create a duty for the defendant to protect them.

---

## Business Invitee

A business has a duty to use reasonable care to prevent injuries to business invitees. A business invitee is a person welcomed inside or onto property by a business for commercial purposes. The business has a duty to discover dangerous artificial conditions that invitees would not reasonably be aware of, and warn invitees of the existence of such conditions or to make such conditions safe.

---

## Landlord Tenant

Similar to business invitee.

Some jurisdictions only find duty where there is a special relationship **and** prior similar incidents that make the third party criminal conduct particularly foreseeable.

---

## Breach

A defendant breached their duty of care if they failed to act as a reasonably prudent person would have acted under the same or similar circumstances. A reasonably prudent person takes precautions to avoid foreseeable risks.

For the reasonably prudent person standard, breach is determined through the application of the Carroll Towing test, which weighs the burden of taking precautions and/or engaging in alternative conduct against the likelihood of harm due to the breach and the potential gravity of harm due to the breach. When likelihood of harm and potential gravity of harm outweigh burden, defendant has breached.

---

## Standard of Care

A defendant owes a foreseeable plaintiff the duty to act as a reasonably prudent person would act under the same or similar circumstances to protect foreseeable plaintiffs from unreasonable risks of harm.

---

## Superior Knowledge

Superior knowledge does not change the reasonably prudent person standard, but it should be considered in the context of the breach analysis. That defendant had superior knowledge or experience is part of the circumstances, and the defendant is expected to act reasonably with that knowledge or experience. A jury can consider how a reasonable person would behave if they knew of the dangers known to the defendant.[^5]

[^5]:Superior knowledge doesn’t tend to change likelihood of harm or potential gravity; goes to burden if the defendant did not have the burden of getting information because they had it.

---

## Dangerous instrumentality

The standard of care for negligence actions involving dangerous instrumentalities and/or dangerous circumstances remains the reasonably prudent person standard *under the circumstances*. Though the standard of care does not vary, the degree of care that is reasonable varies, and must be  proportionate to the foreseeable danger of the activity. Dangerous instrumentality should be considered in the context of the breach analysis.[^6]

[^6]:Dangerous instrumentality heightens likelihood of harm. Can also go to potential gravity.

---

## Mental disability

Mental disability is not considered part of the circumstances, so a person with mental disability is held to the same general standard of care as a reasonably prudent person without mental disability. Therefore, [defendant’s mental disability] does not change the reasonably prudent person standard and cannot be considered in the context of the breach analysis.

---

## Private Standard and Industry Customs

The defendant may have adhered to private standard and industry customs when they acted in a way that caused harm. The private standard and industry custom does not change the reasonably prudent person standard of care, but evidence of private standards and industry customs are admissible at trial, and can impact the breach analysis. However, such evidence does not in itself determine whether the defendant adhered to the ordinary duty of care.[^7]

[^7]:Private standard and industry custom can heighten burden – think of netting which was not customarily installed in the U.S. but anyway was easy and cheap to install so burden to put up netting was low.

---

## Eggshell Plaintiff Rule

Under the common law eggshell plaintiff rule, a defendant is liable for the full extent of a plaintiff’s injury if the type of injury was foreseeable, even if the scope of the injury was not foreseeable. This is true even when the plaintiff has a preexisting condition or sensitivity that exacerbates the injury.

---

## Negligence Per Se

Negligence is conduct that falls below the applicable standard of care. A prima facie negligence claim requires that (1) defendant owed plaintiff a duty of care; (2) defendant breached the duty owed; (3) defendant’s breach was the factual cause of plaintiff’s harm; (4) defendant’s breach was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s harm; and (5) plaintiff suffered legally compensable harm.

Where there is a relevant statute, negligence per se may apply. Negligence per se is the unexcused breach of a specific judge-made or legislature-made law establishing the duty of care. Negligence per se resolves only the duty and breach elements. To prove the entire negligence cause of action, a plaintiff must also show that there was factual causation, proximate causation and actual harm.

*If negligence per se is not satisfied, then the statute does not substitute the reasonably prudent person standard, negligence per se fails, and you default back to using the reasonably prudent person standard.*

---

## Duty for Negligence Per Se

To replace the general duty of care with a duty of care from a statute, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the statute clearly defines the required standard of conduct applicable to the facts of the case; (2) the statute was intended to prevent the type of harm the defendant’s act or omission caused; and (3) the plaintiff is a member of the class of persons the statute was designed to protect.

---

## Breach for Negligence Per Se

Even where a defendant breaches a statutory duty of care, they are not negligent if they have a legally sufficient excuse for violating the statute. Legally sufficient excuses for violating a statute include (1) incapacity; (2) not knowing of occasion for compliance; (3) inability to comply after reasonable diligence or care; (4) emergency not due to own misconduct; and (5) compliance involving greater risk of harm to defendant or others.

---

## Causation

Under torts law, causation is satisfied if there is actual cause and proximate cause.

---

## Actual Cause

A defendant’s conduct is the actual cause of the plaintiff's harm if that harm would not have occurred but for the defendant’s conduct.

To satisfy this standard, defendant’s breach need not be the sole “but for” cause, just a “but for” cause, of plaintiff’s harm.

*If but-for test fails, see if breaching conduct was actual cause under an alternative theory of factual causation.*

---

## Alternative Theory of Actual Causation

In order to serve the underlying goals of tort law, compensation of innocent plaintiffs, courts have developed additional tests for actual cause.

---

## Substantial Factor Test

The substantial factor test provides that the actual cause element is satisfied where (1) there are two or more successive or concurrent causes of plaintiff’s harm; (2) each cause in itself would be sufficient to cause plaintiff’s entire harm; and (3) plaintiff endures a single, indivisible harm.

---

## Alternative Causation Test

The alternative causation test provides that when the “but-for” test does not work, the actual cause element is satisfied as to each defendant where (1) there are two or more defendants, all of whom are before the court; (2) all defendants breached their duty of care; (3) injury was caused by only one of the defendants;  and (4) it was impossible to tell from the facts which defendant caused the injury.

*In such cases, the “but for” analysis does not work; remember the shotguns in the field.*

---

## Proximate Cause

A defendant’s conduct is the proximate cause of an event if the event was foreseeable, and no intervening cause came between the defendant’s conduct and the event.

Proximate cause is not about causation – it is a policy analysis that asks whether it is fair to hold a defendant liable where that defendant is the actual cause of the plaintiff’s harm.

---

## Foreseeability

For defendant’s breach to be a proximate cause of plaintiff’s injury, first, the type of harm suffered by the plaintiff must be a foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s breaching conduct.

*Check whether eggshell plaintiff rule triggered!!*

---

## Intervening Acts

Four types of intervening acts are generally considered unforeseeable (although on the facts, they might be foreseeable). These are (1) acts of nature; (2) intentional torts of third parties; (3) criminal acts of third parties; and (4) gross negligence of third parties. Gross negligence is the “conscious and voluntary disregard of the need to use reasonable care.” It involves a greater degree of carelessness than ordinary negligence.

Generally, ordinary negligence by third parties is a foreseeable intervening cause. However, the foreseeability of all intervening acts (including the above) must be determined by a factual analysis.

---

## Harm or Damages

For a defendant to be liable for negligence, the plaintiff must have suffered a legally compensable harm. Legally compensable harm includes physical or emotional injury to the plaintiff, as well as injury to the plaintiff's property.

OR

Under torts law, harm to the plaintiff must be either bodily harm or harm to property (personal property or real property).

---

## Defenses for Negligence

There are certain defenses that the plaintiff may assert.

---

## Contributory Negligence

Contributory negligence is conduct by the plaintiff that falls below the applicable standard of care and that defendant can raise as a defense against plaintiff’s prima facie negligence claim. Similar to the prima facie case of negligence, contributory negligence requires proof that (1) plaintiff owed herself a duty of care; (2) plaintiff breached the duty owed; (3) plaintiff’s breach was the actual cause of plaintiff’s harm; (4) plaintiff’s breach was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s harm; and (5) plaintiff suffered legally compensable harm.

---

## Duty for Contributory Negligence

The reasonably prudent person standard may or may not apply to the contributory negligence analysis.

*If the reasonably prudent person standard applies, only breach and actual cause need to be analyzed.*

---

## Breach for Contributory Negligence

For contributory negligence, breach is determined through the application of the Carroll Towing test, which weighs the likelihood of harm due to the plaintiff’s breach and the potential gravity of harm due to the plaintiff’s breach against the plaintiff’s burden of taking precautions or engaging in alternative conduct. When the likelihood of harm and gravity of harm outweigh the burden, plaintiff has breached.

*See Carrol Towing analysis for breach above*

---

## Actual Cause for Contributory Negligence

The default test is “but for,” which for contributory negligence asks whether the plaintiff’s harm would have occurred absent the plaintiff’s breaching conduct. To satisfy this standard, plaintiff’s breach need not be the sole “but for” cause, just a “but for” cause, of plaintiff’s harm.

---

## Proximate Cause for Contributory Negligence

A defendant’s conduct is the proximate cause of an event if the event was foreseeable, and no intervening cause came between the defendant’s conduct and the event.

*Do foreseeability and intervening acts analysis (see above).*

---

## Vicarious Liability

Vicarious liability is a doctrine under which an employer can be held liable for the negligence of its employees. In order for an employer to be vicariously liable, (1) the tortfeasor must be an employee of the employer, and (2) the tortfeasor must have acted in the scope of employment.

*If the instructions say to assume that [employee] was an employee of [employer] and that [he/she/they] acted negligently, only the second element – whether [employee] acted negligently in the scope of [his/her/their] employment – needs to be analyzed.*

---

## Negligence for Vicarious Liability

An employee acted negligently in the scope of their employment if they commit a tort within the scope of employment when performing a service in furtherance of the employer’s business.

*See if going and coming rule is triggered*

---

## Going and Coming Rule

When a tort occurs during an employee’s commute to or from work, the Going and Coming rule determines whether the employee was acting in furtherance of the employer’s business at the time. The rule states that an employee going to and from work is ordinarily not acting in furtherance of the employer’s business because they are outside the time and space restrictions of their employment. Therefore, generally, the employer is not vicariously liable for a tort that occurs during an employee’s commute to or from work.

However, there are exceptions to the Going and Coming rule.

---

## Incidental Benefit Exception to Going and Coming Rule

Incidental Benefit is an exception to the Going and Coming rule. Where the trip involves an incidental benefit to employer that is not common to the commute of ordinary members of the work force, the Going and Coming rule does not apply and the employee acts within the scope of employment.

---

## Dual Purpose Exception to Going and Coming Rule

Dual Purpose Doctrine is an exception to the Going and Coming rule. An employer is vicariously liable if, in addition to going home or to work, an employee is performing some work-related task.[^8]

[^8]:From professor’s rubric (watch out because very fact specific but also law): Although plausible, dual purpose is not the strongest argument here because (1) this scenario does not fit the mold of a standard dual purpose exception to the Going and Coming rule because it does not involve the employee performing an additional discrete task while commuting (e.g., picking up tools at the employer’s request on the way to/from work); and (2) the dual purpose analysis relates directly to the employee’s tort (i.e., speeding), rather than to some separate act (e.g., completing an expense report in the Edgewater case). Courts are less likely to glean a dual purpose from the tortious conduct, as tortious conduct is arguably always against the interests of an employer.

## Frolic and Detour

An employee acts within the scope of employment when she commits a tort while performing service in furtherance of the employer’s business. The frolic and detour rules apply to factual scenarios where an employee leaves work during work hours.

The frolic rule states that an employee acts outside the scope of employment when, during work hours, the employee goes to a place not associated with work for a purpose not associated with work and commits a tort then.

The detour rule states that an employee acts within the scope of employment if, during work hours, the employee makes a slight departure from work and commits a tort then.

To distinguish between frolic and detour, courts consider (1) the length of time of departure; (2) physical distance of departure from place or route assigned or expected to be used; and (3) the extent to which the employee was at the time secondarily accomplishing the purpose of employment.
