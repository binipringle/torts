## Rules of Civil Procedure

- {:.indent-3}a. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“FRCP” or “The Rules”)
- {:.indent-3}b. The U.S. Constitution
- {:.indent-3}c. United States Treaties

## Basic Jurisdictional Concepts

- {:.indent-3}a.	Jurisdiction is what gives a court the power to act.
- {:.indent-3}b.	Courts must have both subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction.
- {:.indent-3}c.	If there is no jurisdiction, the court has no power to act on the dispute at hand.

## Subject Matter Jurisdiction

Subject Matter Jurisdiction (SMJx) is the court’s power over a specific dispute, as contrasted to Personal Jurisdiction (PJx) which relates to the court’s power over an individual. SMJx has to do with whether the case can be in state or federal court.

- {:.indent-3}**Subject Matter Jurisdiction in Federal Courts**
- {:.indent-3}A federal court has SMJx if the claim meets at least one of the following requirements:

- {:.indent-5}1 . **Federal Question** 28 USC 1331)
- {:.indent-6}a.	A claim arising under federal statute, U.S. Constitution, or U.S. treaties.
- {:.indent-6}b.	Other exceptions (like if the US is a party, or specialty courts like Bankruptcy)

- {:.indent-5}2 .	**Diversity Jurisdiction (DivJx)** [(28 USC 1332)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1332)
- {:.indent-6}a.	There must be complete diversity of citizenship among all parties
- {:.indent-7}i.	“Citizenship”
- {:.indent-8}1 .	For persons = residence
- {:.indent-8}2 .	For corporations = place of primary business **OR** where it is incorporated
- {:.indent-7}ii.	“Among all parties”
- {:.indent-8}1 .	No plaintiff can be from the same state as any defendant.
- {:.indent-6}b.	**AND** the amount in Controversy must exceed $75K

- {:.indent-5}3 .	**Supplemental Jurisdiction (SuppJx)** [(28 USC 1367)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1367)
- {:.indent-6}a.	When federal court has jurisdiction over some claims, it can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state claims if they arise from the same case or controversy
- {:.indent-7}i.	Same case or controversy = “common nucleus of operative fact”
- {:.indent-7}ii.	In other words, the same transaction or occurrence

[^1]: 28 U.S.C. § 1331 Federal question: The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.

## Erie Doctrine

- {:.indent-3}a.	Relates to which law is applied by the federal court **sitting in Diversity Jurisdiction.**

- {:.indent-3}b.	Allows the federal court to apply its own procedural laws but requires court to apply state substantive law (this is the VERTICAL choice of law - between federal and state courts)

- {:.indent-3}c.	Some state laws are considered procedural and others are considered substantive. The following are some high frequency examples of each:

- {:.indent-4}i.	**Procedural laws**
- {:.indent-5}1 .	Civil procedure rules
- {:.indent-5}2 .	Burden of proof standards

- {:.indent-4}ii.	**Substantive laws**
- {:.indent-5}1 . Claims based in state law
- {:.indent-5}2 .	Damages
- {:.indent-5}3 .	Statute of frauds
- {:.indent-5}4 .	Choice of law rules
- {:.indent-6}a.	A federal court sitting in DivJx must apply the forum state’s choice of law rules to determine which state’s substantive law applies to the action (this isn’t Erie specific, Choice of Law doctrine generally dictates HORIZONTAL choice of law - between different states)

- {:.indent-4}iii.	**Statute of limitations** (SOL) can be procedural or substantive.
- {:.indent-5}1 .	Where a substantive right is conditioned upon SOL -> substantive
- {:.indent-5}2 .	Where a substantive right is not conditioned upon SOL -> procedural


- {:.indent-3}d.	Once applicable state law is determined, the federal court must apply the law as the forum state court would        
- {:.indent-4}i.	The federal court cannot make its own independent judgment on the construction of the law
- {:.indent-4}ii.	When no controlling state case law is available to provide federal court with guidance, the federal court must predict how the state’s highest court would rule on the issue. (sometimes called the “Erie educated guess” principle)

## Personal Jurisdiction

- {:.indent-3}a.	**Pennoyer v. Neff** (will not be on bar exam)

- {:.indent-4}i.	Consent = Def. consents to Jx in a specific forum
- {:.indent-4}ii.	In Personam = Def. served in hand within the forum state
- {:.indent-4}iii.	In Rem = Def has property in forum state + litigation is about that property
- {:.indent-4}iv.	Quasi In Rem = the Def. has property in forum state BUT litigation is not about that property AND court only has Jx up to the value of Def’s property in forum state

- {:.indent-3}b.	**Current Rule that Matters**

- {:.indent-4}i.	A federal court has personal jurisdiction based on either of two categories:
- {:.indent-5}(1) The Traditional Basis of jurisdiction -OR- (2) Long-Arm Jurisdiction

- {:.indent-4}ii.	Traditional Basis of Personal Jurisdiction (over defendant)
- {:.indent-5}1 .	Domicile – where the Def. resides OR
- {:.indent-5}2 .	Presence in the state when served OR
- {:.indent-5}3 .	Consent – Def. consents to Jx in specific forum OR
- {:.indent-5}4 .	Waiver – appearing in the action without objecting OR
- {:.indent-5}5 .	ANY OF THESE must meet constitutional requirement of due process*

- {:.indent-4}iii.	Long-Arm Jurisdiction
- {:.indent-5}1 .	Applies when defendant is not a resident of the forum state -AND-
- {:.indent-5}2 .	The forum state must have a long-arm statute AND must meet the constitutional requirement for due process*

- {:.indent-4}iv.	*Constitutional requirement for due process – both prongs must be satisfied
- {:.indent-5}1 .	Minimum contacts (more to come!) -AND-
- {:.indent-5}2 .	Fair Play and Substantial Justice (more to come!)
