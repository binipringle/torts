Prima Facie Negligence Analysis

Governing Issue: Whether [defendant] was negligent when [defendant’s conduct].

Governing Rule: Negligence is conduct that falls below the applicable standard of care. A prima facie negligence case requires that (1) defendant owed plaintiff a duty of care; (2) defendant breached the duty owed; (3) defendant’s breach was the actual cause of plaintiff’s harm; (4) defendant’s breach was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s harm; and (5) plaintiff suffered legally compensable harm.

Element 1: Duty/Standard of Care

Issue 1: The first issue is whether [defendant] owed [plaintiff] a duty of care.

Rule 1: Defendants only owe a duty of care to foreseeable plaintiffs. To be a foreseeable plaintiff, the plaintiff must be within the zone of danger created by defendant’s conduct. To determine whether plaintiff is in the zone of danger, courts consider the relationship between plaintiff and defendant, the time and space between plaintiff and defendant’s breach, and other facts relevant to whether plaintiff was foreseeable.

For defendant’s breaching conduct to be a proximate cause of plaintiff’s harm, the type of harm must be a reasonably foreseeable consequence of defendant’s breaching conduct.

Unless the egg shell plaintiff rule applies: Where plaintiff has a preexisting condition that makes them suffer an injury that is an unforeseeable consequence of defendant’s breaching conduct, the breaching conduct is nonetheless the proximate cause of plaintiff’s injury.

Application 1: Here, …

Conclusion 1:  Therefore, because [plaintiff] was a foreseeable plaintiff, [defendant] owed [plaintiff] a duty of care.

Applicable Standard of Care:

Issue 2: The second issue is what the applicable duty of care is.

Rule 2: [Defendant] owed [plaintiff] the duty to act as a reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances to protect foreseeable plaintiffs from unreasonable risks of harm.

If triggered, add to rule (I can add more than one and I should add more than one if triggered!!!):

Superior knowledge (doesn’t tend to change likelihood of harm or potential gravity; goes to burden if the defendant did not have the burden of getting information because they had it):

Based on [facts that show superior knowledge, i.e. training], [defendant] arguably had superior knowledge about [facts that led to harm. i.e. litter on floor]. Superior knowledge does not change the reasonably prudent person standard, but it should be considered in the context of the breach analysis. That defendant had superior knowledge or experience is part of the circumstances, and the defendant is expected to act reasonably with that knowledge or experience. A jury can consider how a reasonable person would behave if they knew of the dangers known to the defendant.

Dangerous instrumentality (heightens likelihood of harm – can also go to potential gravity):

Based on [facts that show dangerous instrumentality], [defendant] arguably used a dangerous instrumentality when [facts/conduct that led to harm]. The standard of care for negligence actions involving dangerous instrumentalities and/or dangerous circumstances remains “reasonable care” under the circumstances (reasonably prudent person standard). Though the standard of care does not vary, the degree of care that is reasonable varies, and must be  proportionate to the foreseeable danger of the activity. Dangerous instrumentality should be considered in the context of the breach analysis.

Emergency (emergency will heighten the burden in the third part of the Caroll Towing analysis!):

Based on [facts that show emergency], [defendant]’s conduct was likely affected by an emergency when [facts/conduct that led to harm]. Emergency does not change the reasonably prudent person standard, but emergencies are considered part of the circumstances, and can alter what degree of care is considered reasonable. An emergency is defined as a sudden and unforeseeable occurrence or condition that calls for immediate action, and that was not caused by the defendant’s negligence.  Facts that show emergency should be considered in the context of the breach analysis.

Mental disability:

Based on [facts that show mental disability], [defendant] arguably had a mental disability when [facts that led to harm]. Mental disability is not considered part of the circumstances, so a person with mental disability is held to the same general standard of care as a reasonably prudent person without mental disability. Therefore, [defendant’s mental disability] does not change the reasonably prudent person standard and cannot be considered in the context of the breach analysis.

Private standard and industry customs (lack of custom in the U.S. can heighten burden – think of netting which was not customarily installed in the U.S. but anyway was easy and cheap to install so burden was low – that was a counterargument and rebuttal):

Based on [facts that show private standard and industry customs], [defendant] arguably adhered to private standard and industry customs when [facts/conduct that led to harm]. The private standard and industry custom does not change the reasonably prudent person standard of care, but evidence of private standards and industry customs are admissible at trial, and can impact the breach analysis. However, such evidence does not in itself determine whether the defendant adhered to the ordinary duty of care.

Element 2: Breach

Issue 1: The next issue is whether [defendant] breached [his/her/their] duty to [plaintiff].

Rule 1: For the reasonably prudent person standard, breach is determined through the application of the Carroll Towing test, which weighs the burden of taking precautions and/or engaging in alternative conduct against the likelihood of harm due to the breach and the potential gravity of harm due to the breach. When likelihood of harm and potential gravity of harm outweigh burden, defendant has breached.

Application 1: Here, the likelihood of harm from [allegedly breaching conduct] is [low/medium/high]. Although the [place where breach occurred] arguably contains dangerous instrumentalities [(dangerous instrumentalities)] and is [other facts], we have country-wide statistics that reflect a [low/medium/high] likelihood of harm. This rate is not unique to [circumstances], but is typical of [similar circumstances] across the country. Even if [breaching conduct] caused damage, the rate would be rather low relative to [similar circumstances] over the years.  Moreover, of [something] [something], making the likelihood of harm even lower.

The potential gravity of harm is [low/medium/high] [high, as would be expected from a dangerous instrumentality]. We are told that injuries from [something] cause [some kind of harm]. Theoretically, [harm] could even cause death. Thus, although the likelihood of harm is [low/medium/high], when harm does occur due to [breaching conduct], it is [serious/not serious].

The burden of taking precautions/engaging in alternative conduct is [low/medium/high]. To take precautions, [defendant] would have had to [do something]. Although [plaintiff] might argue that such an expense posed at least a medium burden due to their financial struggles (implicit counter-argument), this is entirely unconvincing. [Plaintiff] had enough money to [pay for something because]. Indeed, [something] would enhance [something] and possibly improve [something].

Finally, given how available and inexpensive [something] is, that its use is not customary in the United States (implicit counterargument) does not raise [defendant]’s burden.

Conclusion 1: Given a [low/medium/high] likelihood of harm, [low/medium/high] potential gravity of harm, and a [low/medium/high] burden of alternative conduct, [defendant] breached [his/her/their] duty to [plaintiff].

Negligence per se

Main Issue: Whether [plaintiff] can establish a prima facie claim of negligence against [defendant] using the doctrine of negligence per se when [act that led to harm and harm].

Governing Rule: Negligence is conduct that falls below the applicable standard of care. A prima facie negligence claim requires that: (1) defendant owed plaintiff a duty of care; (2) defendant breached the duty owed; (3) defendant’s breach was the actual cause of plaintiff’s harm; (4) defendant’s breach was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s harm; and (5) plaintiff suffered legally compensable harm.

Where there is a relevant statute, negligence per se may apply. Negligence per se is the unexcused breach of a specific judge-made or legislature-made law establishing the duty of care. Negligence per se resolves only the duty and breach elements. To prove the entire negligence cause of action, a plaintiff must also show that there was actual causation, proximate causation and actual harm.

Element 1: Duty (negligence per se)

Issue 1: The first issue is whether the statute requiring [what the statute requires] replaces the reasonably prudent person standard/general duty of care for this case.

Rule 1: To replace the general duty of care with a duty of care from a statute, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the statute clearly defines the required standard of conduct applicable to the facts of the case; (2) the statute was intended to prevent the type of harm the defendant’s act or omission caused; and (3) the plaintiff is a member of the class of persons the statute was designed to protect.

Application 1: First, the statute clearly defines the required standard of conduct applicable to the facts of this case. The statute explicitly states that [what the statute states it requires] [OR] The statute prohibits [what the statute prohibits]. [facts that show that defendant’s conduct was what the statute prohibits]. This requirement applies directly to the facts of this case because [explain why using facts].

Second, the statute was [intended/not intended] to prevent the type of harm [defendant’s conduct] caused. The statute was intended to prevent [what the statute was intended to prevent], [and here it prevented/not to prevent] [harm suffered by plaintiff]. Here, [plaintiff] alleges that [defendant’s conduct] caused [harm suffered by plaintiff], [and the statute seeks to prevent that kind of harm/not [harm statute prohibits]]. [plaintiff]’s [harm] are exactly the types of injuries that could be expected from [facts].

Third, [plaintiff] [is clearly/is clearly not] a member of the class of people the statute was designed to protect. The statute was designed to protect people who [do whatever the people the statute seeks to prevent do]. Plaintiff [did/did not] [do whatever the people the statute seeks to prevent do], [but instead allegedly did something else].

If satisfied:

Conclusion 1: The statutory duty replaces the general duty of care here because the statute clearly defines the applicable standard of conduct, the statute was intended to prevent the very type of harm [plaintiff] suffered, and [plaintiff] is a member of the class of persons the statute was designed to protect. Therefore, negligence per se applies.

Element 2: Breach (for negligence per se analysis only!)

Issue 2/Rule 2/Application 2/Conclusion 2: The next issue is whether [defendant] breached the statutory duty of care. As a [type of business or person], [defendant] clearly breached the statutory duty to [not do what statute prohibits]. [Defendant] clearly {facts]. Therefore, defendant breached the statutory duty of care.

Issue 3: The next issue is whether [defendant] has any legally sufficient excuses for violating the [name of statute] statute.

Rule 3: Even where a defendant breaches a statutory duty of care, they are not negligent if they have a legally sufficient excuse for violating the statute. Legally sufficient excuses for violating a statute include: (1) incapacity; (2) not knowing of occasion for compliance; (3) inability to comply after reasonable diligence or care; (4) emergency not due to own misconduct; and (5) compliance involving greater risk of harm to defendant or others.

Application 3: None of these excuses applies to [defendant]’s circumstances.

First, there is absolutely no indication that [defendant] lacked capacity to comply with [what statute requires compliance with]. To the contrary, [facts], which suggests that [defendant] was more than capable of [complying with the statute].

Second, [defendant] clearly knew of the occasion for compliance with the statute. [facts that show that defendant knew]. Thus, under the circumstances, [defendant] must have known of the need for statutory compliance.

Third, [defendant] did not demonstrate an inability to comply with the statute after reasonable diligence, as [facts that show this] and [he/she/they] had the time and opportunity to comply. OR as [facts] show that [defendant could have complied but made no effort to comply}.

Fourth, [defendant] did not confront an emergency (or sudden and unforeseen occurrence) not due to [his/her/their] own misconduct that impeded [his/her/their] ability to comply with the statute. [facts that show that whatever happened was foreseeable and therefore not an emergency].

Fifth, there is no indication whatsoever that complying with the statute by [doing something to comply w statute] involved greater risk of harm to [plaintiff] or others than failing to do [what the statute requires]. Compliance would have required [what compliance would have required]. However, such inconvenience does not come close to outweighing the risk associated with [something else].

Conclusion 3: Thus, [defendant] has no excuses for breaching [his/her/their] statutory duty of care to [do what statute provides].

Now go to actual causation!

If negligence per se not satisfied:

Conclusion 3: Therefore, [defendant] did not have a statutory duty of care to prevent [harm suffered by plaintiff] because all the elements of statutory duty of care are not satisfied. Although the standard of conduct applicable to defendant’s conduct is defined by the statute, the statute was not intended to prevent [harm suffered by plaintiff], and [plaintiff] [was/was not] a member of the class of people that the statute was designed to protect.

Note: If negligence per se is not satisfied, then the statute does not substitute the reasonably prudent person standard, negligence per se fails, and you default back to using the reasonably prudent person standard.

Element 3: Actual cause

Note: if multiple defendants: analyze one by one.

If satisfied:

Issue 4: The next issue is whether [defendant]’s breach is a actual cause of [plaintiff]’s harm.

Rule 3: The default test is the “but for” test, which asks whether the plaintiff’s harm would have occurred absent the defendant’s breaching conduct. To satisfy this standard, defendant’s breach need not be the sole “but for” cause, just a “but for” cause, of plaintiff’s harm.

Application 4: Here, the “but for” standard is satisfied. But for [defendant’s breaching conduct], [facts that led to harm], [harm]. That [other actual causes] are also “but for” causes of [plaintiff]’s harm does not negate that [defendant]’s breach is a “but for” cause.

Conclusion 4: Therefore, [defendant]’s breach is a actual cause of [plaintiff’s harm] under the “but-for” test.

Conclusion: Thus, [defendant] owed [plaintiff] the reasonably prudent person standard of care, [defendant] breached the duty owed to [plaintiff] and [defendant]’s breach was the actual cause of [plaintiff]’s injury.

Conclusion: Thus, [defendant]’s failure to [not engage in breaching conduct] is a actual cause of [plaintiff]’s harm under the “but for” test.

(Counterargument & Rebuttal) [Defendant] may argue that there were other “but for” causes of [defendant]’s harm, including [facts that show this]. However, to satisfy the actual cause element, [plaintiff] need not prove that [defendant]’s breach was the sole “but for” cause of her harm. As established above, for prima facie purposes, [plaintiff] can prove that [defendant]’s breach was a “but for” cause of [his/her/their] harm.

If “but-for” test not satisfied:

Rule 4 + Application 4 + Conclusion 4: The default test is “but for,” which asks whether the plaintiff’s harm would have occurred absent the defendant’s breaching conduct. If the harm would not have occurred absent the breach, then the breach is a but-for cause. Here, it cannot be said that [defendant]’s breach is a but-for cause of [plaintiff]’s harm. According to the facts, had [defendant not engaged in breaching conduct], [other but-for cause] alone would have been sufficient to cause [plaintiff]’s harm.

(Counterargument & Rebuttal): There is an argument that [harm would not have been caused] without [defendant’s breaching conduct] and therefore might not [created the circumstances that caused harm]. [Counterargument]. However, as best we can tell from these facts, [other cause] would have caused [harm] even without [defendant’s breaching conduct]. [Rebuttal].

Conclusion 4: Therefore, [defendant’s breaching conduct] [is/is not] not the but-for cause of [plaintiff]’s injury.

Note: If but-for test fails, see if breaching conduct was actual cause under an alternative theory of actual causation.

Alternative Theory of Actual causation:

Issue 5: The next issue is whether [defendant]’s breach is the actual cause of [plaintiff]’s harm under an alternative theory of actual causation.

If substantial factor test is triggered:

Rule 5: In order to serve the underlying goals of tort law, compensation of innocent plaintiffs, courts have developed additional tests for actual cause. The substantial factor test provides that the actual cause element is satisfied where: (1) there are two or more successive or concurrent causes of plaintiff’s harm; (2) each cause in itself would be sufficient to cause plaintiff’s entire harm; and (3) plaintiff endures a single, indivisible harm.

Application 5: Here, substantial factor is satisfied because (1) [cause of harm] and [cause of harm] are concurrent causes of [plaintiff]’s harm ; (2) per the facts, each [cause of harm] alone would have been sufficient to cause [plaintiff]’s entire harm; and (3) [plaintiff] endured a single, indivisible harm – [harm].

Conclusion 5: Therefore, [defendant]’s breach is a actual cause of [plaintiff]’s harm under the substantial factor test.

If alternative causation is triggered:

Rule 4: In order to serve the underlying goals of tort law – compensation of innocent plaintiffs – courts have developed alternate tests for actual cause. The alternative causation test provides that, when the “but-for” test does not work, the actual cause element is satisfied as to each defendant where (1) there are two or more defendants, all of whom are before the court; (2) all defendants breached their duty of care; (3) injury was caused by only one of the defendants;  and (4) it was impossible to tell from the facts which defendant caused the injury. (In such cases, the “but for” analysis does not work; remember the shotguns in the field)

Application 4: Here, alternative causation is satisfied because: (1) both defendants, [defendant A] and [defendant B], are before the court because the plaintiff has sued both of them;  (2) both defendants breached their duty of care in the same way, though [defendant B] conceded breach while [defendant A] breached under the above Carroll Towing analysis; (3) only [defendant A] or [defendant B] caused the injury because [facts], but (4) there is no way to tell from the facts which defendant caused the injury because [facts].

Conclusion 4: Therefore, [defendant]’s breach is a actual cause of [plaintiff]’s harm under the alternative causation test.

Issue 5: Proximate Cause

Issue 5: The next issue is whether [defendant]’s breach is a proximate cause of [plaintiff]’s harm.

Rule 5: Proximate cause is not about causation – it is a policy analysis that asks whether it is fair to hold a defendant liable where that defendant is the actual cause of the plaintiff’s harm. For defendant’s breach to be a proximate cause of plaintiff’s injury, first, the type of harm suffered by the plaintiff must be a foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s breaching conduct.

If eggshell rule triggered:

Unless the egg shell plaintiff rule applies. Where the plaintiff has a preexisting condition that  makes her suffer injury that is an unforeseeable consequence of defendant’s breaching conduct, the breaching  conduct is nonetheless the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury.

Application 5: [Defendant]’s harm – in particular, [his/her/their] [specific harm] – was a perfectly foreseeable consequence of [defendant]’s [breaching conduct]. A reasonable person in [defendant]’s position could certainly foresee that [facts that show likelihood of harm].

Conclusion 5: Thus, [plaintiff]’s harm was a foreseeable consequence of [defendant]’s breach under the circumstances and therefore does not defeat proximate cause.

Rule 6: Additionally, for defendant’s breach to be a proximate cause of plaintiff’s harm, any intervening acts or events (between breach and injury) must be foreseeable to the defendant (i.e., a reasonably prudent person in defendant’s position). If an intervening act or event is unforeseeable to the defendant, then it is superseding and cuts off defendant’s liability.  

Four types of intervening acts are generally considered unforeseeable (although on the facts, they might be foreseeable). These are (1) acts of nature; (2) intentional torts of third parties; (3) criminal acts of third parties; and (4) gross negligence of third parties. Gross negligence is the “conscious and voluntary disregard of the need to use reasonable care.” It involves a greater degree of carelessness than ordinary negligence.

Generally, ordinary negligence by third parties is a foreseeable intervening cause. However, the foreseeability of all intervening acts (including the above) must be determined by a factual analysis.

Application 6/Counterargument 6: The intervening acts or events between [defendant]’s breach of [breaching conduct] and [plaintiff]’s harm are (1) [intervening cause 1]; (2) [intervening cause 2]; (3) [intervening cause 3]; (4) [intervening cause 4]; (5) [intervening cause 5]; and (6) [intervening cause 6].

First, [person]’s [conduct or failure to do something that was the intervening cause] is foreseeable to a reasonably prudent person in [person]’s position. [Plaintiff] would argue that [person]’s [conduct or failure to do something that was the intervening cause] is no worse than generally foreseeable ordinary negligence since [facts]. [Defendant] might argue that [person] was unforeseeably grossly negligent when [facts] because [reasoning]. However, [plaintiff] likely has the stronger argument here. [facts and reasoning].

Second, [person]’s [conduct or failure to do something that was the intervening cause] is foreseeable to a reasonably prudent person in [person]’s position. [facts and reasoning].

Third, [person]’s [conduct or failure to do something that was the intervening cause] is foreseeable to a reasonably prudent person in [person]’s position. [facts and reasoning].

There is another way of setting it up if I’m just going to analyze two intervening causes:

Application/Counterargument 6:

One intervening cause here is [intervening cause]. Such [act] was highly foreseeable to a reasonable [person/company] in [defendant]’s position. After all, [facts and reasoning]. [counterargument] However, given that [defendant] did not act with conscious disregard of [something], as [facts], [his/her/their conduct] is likely to amount only to foreseeable ordinary negligence.

A second intervening cause is [intervening cause]. It was entirely foreseeable to a to a reasonable [person/company] in [defendant]’s position that [facts]. [Plaintiff might argue that argument] but [rebuttal]. [Facts] suggest that [defendant] was not acting in conscious disregard of the risk posed by [intervening cause] and was rather only ordinarily negligent, which is always foreseeable.

Conclusion 6: Therefore, there are no superseding causes on these facts and [defendant]’s breach is a proximate cause of [plaintiff]’s harm.

Element 5: Harm

Issue 7/Rule 7/Application 7/Conclusion 7: The final issue is whether [plaintiff] suffered a legally compensable harm. Legally compensable harm includes physical or emotional injury to person, as well as injury to property. Here, [plaintiff] suffered [type of harm] in the form of [harm], which satisfies this element.

Conclusion

If negligence per se:

Overall Conclusion: Because [defendant] breached [his/her/their] statutory duty of care, [defendant]’s breach was a factual and proximate cause of [plaintiff]’s harm, and [plaintiff]’s harm is legally compensable, [plaintiff] can make out a prima facie case of negligence against [defendant]’s under a theory of negligence per se.

If reasonably prudent person standard (Carroll Towing):

Overall conclusion: Therefore, [defendant] owed [plaintiff] a duty to act as a reasonably prudent person [(company)], [he/she/they/it] breached that duty of care per the Carroll Towing analysis, [his/her/their/its] breach was a actual cause of [plaintiff]’s harm under a theory of [alternative causation], [defendant]’s breach was a proximate cause of [his/her/their] harm, and that [he/she/they] endured legally compensable harm.

Defenses

Issue: The next issue is whether any defenses are available to [defendant].

Contributory Negligence  Defense

In 2020 final the question was: Question I (2) – Assume Issa has a valid negligence claim against Cora’s Car Repair. Using the reasonably prudent person standard, please analyze whether Cora’s could satisfy the breach and actual cause elements of a contributory negligence defense against Issa’s claim.

Governing Rule: Contributory negligence is conduct by the plaintiff that falls below the applicable standard of care and that defendant can raise as a defense against plaintiff’s prima facie negligence claim. Similar to the prima facie case of negligence, contributory negligence requires proof that: (1) plaintiff owed herself a duty of care; (2) plaintiff breached the duty owed; (3) plaintiff’s breach was the actual cause of plaintiff’s harm; (4) plaintiff’s breach was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s harm; and (5) plaintiff suffered legally compensable harm.

Per the instructions, the reasonably prudent person standard applies to the contributory negligence analysis here, and only breach and actual cause need to be analyzed.

Breach (contributory negligence)

Issue 1/Rule 1: The first issue is whether [plaintiff] breached the duty of reasonable care to [himself/herself/themselves]. For contributory negligence, breach is determined through the application of the Carroll Towing test, which weighs the likelihood of harm due to the plaintiff’s breach and the potential gravity of harm due to the plaintiff’s breach against the plaintiff’s burden of taking precautions/engaging in alternative conduct. When likelihood of harm and gravity of harm outweigh burden, plaintiff has breached.

Custom and industry standards (if triggered) (not sure if in right place here)

Based on [defendant]’s internal policy that requires [what policy requires], [defendant] arguably failed to adhere to its private standard and industry custom when it [facts]. The private standard and industry custom does not change the reasonably prudent person standard of care, but evidence of private standards and industry customs are admissible at trial, and can impact the breach analysis. However, such evidence does not in itself determine whether the defendant adhered to the ordinary duty of care.

Application 1: The likelihood of harm from [plaintiff’s conduct] is [low/medium-low/medium/medium-high/high/very high/etc.]. [analysis of facts and reasoning]. Thus, given the information provided [and common knowledge], the likelihood of harm from [plaintiff]’s breach is at least [low/medium-low/medium/medium-high/high/very high/etc.] under these circumstances.

The potential gravity of harm from [plaintiff’s conduct] is [low/medium-low/medium/medium-high/high/very high/etc.]. [analysis of facts and reasoning]. Finally, while [plaintiff’s harm] probably rise only to the level of a medium gravity of harm, under the totality of the circumstances, the overall potential gravity of harm here is at least [medium-high/high/very high/etc.].

[Plaintiff]’s burden of taking precautions/engaging in alternative conduct was [medium-high/high/very high/etc.]. [Plaintiff] would argue that the burden of [not engaging in conduct] is at least [medium-high/high/very high/etc.] given [facts]. However, there were numerous low-burden alternatives. [Plaintiff] could have [alternative course of action] or [alternative course of action]. Also, since [plaintiff knew in advance/had time, he/she/they] had time to look into additional options, including [alternative option]. Thus, the burden of alternative conduct was low.

Conclusion 1: Given that the [medium-high/high/very high/etc.] likelihood of harm and the [medium-high/high/very high/etc.] potential gravity of harm outweigh the low burden, Issa breached her duty of reasonable care to herself.

Actual cause (contributory negligence)

Issue 2: The next issue is whether [plaintiff]’s breach - [plaintiff’s breaching conduct] - was the actual cause of [his/her/their] harm.

Rule 2: The default test is “but for,” which for contributory negligence asks whether the plaintiff’s harm would have occurred absent the plaintiff’s breaching conduct. To satisfy this standard, plaintiff’s breach need not be the sole “but for” cause, just a “but for” cause, of plaintiff’s harm.

Application 2 + Conclusion 2: Here, the “but for” standard is satisfied. But for [plaintiff’s breaching conduct], [plaintiff] would have been unharmed, just like [other people if applicable]. While there are additional but-for causes of [plaintiff]’s harm, including [additional but-for causes], plaintiff’s breach need not be the sole but-for cause to satisfy actual cause. Therefore, [plaintiff]’s breach is a actual cause of [his/her/their] harm because it is one of the but-for causes of [his/her/their] harm.

Vicarious Liability

In 2020 final the question was: Question II – Assuming Blaze was an employee of Felipe’s Fire Fantasies and that he was negligent in hitting the parked car, please analyze whether the car owner has a prima facie claim of vicarious liability against Felipe’s Fire Fantasies.

Overall Issue: The issue is whether [employee] has a prima facie claim of vicarious liability against [employer], even though [employee] was [doing something like commuting to work or taking a break] when [he/she/they] negligently [caused the harm].

Governing Rule: Vicarious liability is a doctrine under which an employer can be held liable for the negligence of its employees. In order for an employer to be vicariously liable, two elements must be satisfied: (1) the tortfeasor must be an employee of the employer, and (2) the tortfeasor must have acted in the scope of employment.

Since the instructions say to assume that [employee] was an employee of [employer] and that [he/she/they] acted negligently, only the second element – whether [employee] acted negligently in the scope of [his/her/their] employment – needs to be analyzed.

Issue 1: The issue is whether [employee] acted negligently in the scope of [his/her/their] employment with [employer].

Rule 1: An employee commits a tort within the scope of employment when performing a service in furtherance of the employer’s business.

If going and coming triggered

When a tort occurs during an employee’s commute to or from work, the Going and Coming rule determines whether the employee was acting in furtherance of the employer’s business at the time. The rule states that an employee going to and from work is ordinarily not acting in furtherance of the employer’s business because they are outside the time and space restrictions of their employment. Therefore, generally, the employer is not vicariously liable for a tort that occurs during an employee’s commute to or from work.

However, there are exceptions to the Going and Coming rule, including:

(1) Incidental Benefit: Where the trip involves an incidental benefit to employer that is not common to the commute of ordinary members of the work force, the Going and Coming rule does not apply and the employee acts within the scope of employment. (See, e.g., Hinman)

(2) Dual Purpose Doctrine: An employer is vicariously liable if, in addition to going home or to work, an employee is performing some work-related task.

(3) Special Hazard: An employer is vicariously liable when the employee’s commute involves a special hazard.

Application 1: The Going and Coming rule applies here because [employee] committed a tort while commuting from [home to work/work to home]. Therefore, [he/she/they] acted outside the scope of [his/her/their] employment and [employer] is not vicariously liable unless one or more exception applies.

The first exception [applies because facts] [is inapplicable because there are no facts to suggest that [employee]’s commute created an incidental benefit to his employer that is not typical of the commute of ordinary members of the work force.]

The third exception [is inapplicable because facts] [clearly applies]. [employee]’s commute involved a special hazard because [facts].

The second exception [is inapplicable] [also could be said to apply]. It could be argued that [employee] acted with a dual purpose when [facts]. At the same time, [employee’s act] potentially served the employer’s purposes because [facts].

From professor’s rubric (watch out because very fact specific but also law): Although plausible, dual purpose is not the strongest argument here because (1) this scenario does not fit the mold of a standard dual purpose exception to the Going and Coming rule because it does not involve the employee performing an additional discrete task while commuting (e.g., picking up tools at the employer’s request on the way to/from work); and (2) the dual purpose analysis relates directly to the employee’s tort (i.e., speeding), rather than to some separate act (e.g., completing an expense report in the Edgewater case). Courts are less likely to glean a dual purpose from the tortious conduct, as tortious conduct is arguably always against the interests of an employer.

Conclusion 1: [Employee] committed a tort within the scope of his employment because his commute to work involved [an incidental benefit/a dual purpose/a special hazard] in the form of [doing something that caused that].

If frolic and detour triggered:

Rule 1: An employee acts within the scope of employment when she commits a tort while performing service in furtherance of the employer’s business.

The frolic and detour rules apply to factual scenarios where an employee leaves work during work hours.

The frolic rule states that an employee acts outside the scope of employment when, during work hours, the employee goes to a place not associated with work for a purpose not associated with work and commits a tort then. The detour rule states that an employee acts within the scope of employment if, during work hours, the employee makes a slight departure from work and commits a tort then.

To distinguish between frolic and detour, the court will consider the following factors: (1) length of time of departure; (2) physical distance of departure from place or route assigned or expected to be used; and (3) the extent to which the employee was at the time secondarily accomplishing the purpose of employment.

Application 1: Here, the length of time of the departure weighs [in favor of/against] frolicking. [facts and reasoning].

The physical distance of departure from the route assigned [also] weighs [in favor of/against]  frolicking. [facts and reasoning].

Finally, the extent to which [employee] was secondarily accomplishing the purpose of [his/her/their] employment weighs [in favor of/against] frolicking. [facts and reasoning]. Although [employee] arguably had a personal motivation to [make their detour or frolic], there’s also a strong argument that [employee] was secondarily accomplishing the purpose of [his/her/their] employment by [doing something].

The [party bringing suit against employer] might argue that [counterargument]. However, [rebuttal].

Conclusion 1: Therefore, [employee] most likely [was/was not] frolicking, so [he/she/they] [was/was not] acting within the scope of [his/her/their] employment.

If satisfied:

Overall Conclusion: In conclusion, because [employee] is an employee of [employer] and acted within the scope of [his/her/their] employment when [he/she/they] negligently injured the plaintiff, the plaintiff does have a prima facie case of vicarious liability against the restaurant.

If not satisfied:

Overall Conclusion: In conclusion, the [party bringing suit against employer] does not have a prima facie case of vicarious liability against [employer] because, while [employee] is an employee of [employer], [he/she/they] did not act within the scope of [his/her/their]  employment.
