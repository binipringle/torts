## Personal jurisdiction analysis flow

Where was defendant properly served?

**If in forum state:** Traditional test (general jurisdiction applies)

- Domicile
- Presence
- Waiver
- Consent

*General jurisdiction: claims do not have to arise from or relate to d’s contacts with forum state –defendant can be sued for essentially anything (i.e. courts have personal jurisdiction over defendant generally)*

**If not served in forum state:**

- Is defendant a citizen of the forum state?
- **No** > is there a **long arm statute?** If yes, long arm statute > were there **minimum contacts?** > was there **fair play/substantial justice?** (discuss factors and come to conclusion about fairness)

- This takes us to **specific jurisdiction** (plaintiff's claims arise out of or relate to the defendant’s contact with the forum state (i.e. courts have personal jurisdiction over defendant in this specific dispute))

**Watch out because contacts might be so substantial that the defendant is essentially “at home” in the forum state (if at home court has general jurisdiction) - in other words, “so systematic and continuous that defendant is essentially at home in the forum state”**

If unsure, do **purposeful availment analysis:** The defendant purposefully availed themself of the benefits of the forum state AND should have anticipated that personal jurisdiction was foreseeable (only go to purposeful availment analysis if ...).

*Remember PRESENCE!! If person properly served in forum state, general jurisdiction is proper based on presence alone.*
